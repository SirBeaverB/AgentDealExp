Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and low data entropy, which indicates it is reliable and stable. While the market demand is moderate (0.3), the capacity is sufficient, suggesting that it can handle its intended use. However, the NULL values for Model Performance Improvement and History introduce some uncertainty, which limits the overall confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance performance effectively. It also has a low Data Entropy, suggesting that the data is of high quality and less variable, which is attractive for buyers. The long Data Life indicates that the value of the data will persist over time. However, the market score of 0.3 suggests there is limited demand or competition, which could restrain the price. Considering these factors, a price of 5000 seems reasonable.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
