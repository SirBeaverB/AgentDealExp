Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': "The lack of available traits severely limits the ability to assess the product's value. Without performance metrics, capacity, or market data, it is difficult to justify a higher price. This estimate assumes a minimal baseline value.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in the model's effectiveness, which can be attractive in a competitive market. However, the NULL values for capacity, data entropy, and history limit the assessment of the product's overall utility and market fit. The long data life suggests potential longevity in usage, but the incomplete information affects the overall valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1650.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the significant value of the data product, particularly with a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates a tangible enhancement in effectiveness that can drive competitive advantages. The long data life further suggests its utility over time, making this a compelling investment.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1000. The lack of available traits and performance metrics significantly limits the ability to assess the product's true value, making a baseline price of 1000 more justifiable.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. I believe this price reflects the valuable Model Performance Improvement of 0.3 and the long data life, while also considering the lower valuation concerns raised. This balanced approach ensures we both can find common ground.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1600. This price reflects a fair compromise, acknowledging the Model Performance Improvement of 0.3 and the data's longevity while also considering the concerns about the absence of certain traits and metrics. It's a reasonable midpoint that recognizes both the strengths and limitations of the product.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1650. The significant Model Performance Improvement of 0.3 and the product's long data life warrant a price that reflects its value, while still being competitive in this negotiation. Let's aim for a fair deal that recognizes the strengths of the data.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1650. The Model Performance Improvement of 0.3 and the long data life are valuable assets that justify a competitive offer, while still acknowledging the previous discussions. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
