Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 0.3), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a respectable enhancement in performance, which can be valuable for users seeking better outcomes from their data products. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle typical usage demands. However, the medium data entropy implies that there may be some unpredictability in the data, and the NULL traits indicate a lack of critical information, which limits the confidence in the valuation. Overall, while there are positive aspects, the missing information reduces certainty about the product\'s overall value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '8000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates it can enhance the performance of existing systems. The capacity is described as "enough," suggesting it can handle the necessary workload effectively. The medium data entropy implies a reasonable level of complexity and variability in the data, making it useful in various applications. The long data life indicates that the data remains relevant for an extended period, adding further value. However, the market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, which tempers the overall valuation. The lack of historical data limits confidence but not excessively.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:No deal.
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 9000.
