Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing for users looking for improvements in efficiency. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle the required workload. However, the low data entropy and medium data life are positive traits, indicating stability and reliability, but the lack of historical data and market context limits the overall value assessment. Therefore, a conservative price is set based on the available traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The data product shows a moderate improvement in model performance (MPI of 0.2) and has a low data entropy, indicating reliability and predictability in its outputs. Although the market size is relatively low (0.3), the capacity is deemed sufficient, which suggests that there is potential for use in practical applications. The medium data life indicates that the product may remain relevant for a reasonable duration. However, the lack of historical data limits the confidence in the valuation, but the other factors support a moderate price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
