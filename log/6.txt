{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('small', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': ([7200, 8100, 1100, 400, 4500], [7200, 8100, 1100, 400, 4500]), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': "The product's data life is short, which limits its long-term value. Additionally, the lack of available traits such as Model Performance Improvement and Capacity suggests uncertainty in its effectiveness or utility. The history values indicate some usage but are not compelling enough to suggest a high market demand.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement, but the overall market rating of 0.3 reflects limited demand. Additionally, the small capacity and low data entropy suggest that the product may not have wide applicability. The short data life implies that the product may not be sustainable in the long term. Therefore, the pricing is conservative based on these factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
