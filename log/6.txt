Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'low'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product has enough capacity and low data entropy, indicating it can efficiently handle data processing with minimal noise. However, the market value is relatively low at 0.3, suggesting limited demand. The NULL traits indicate a lack of essential performance metrics, which affects the overall confidence in the product's capabilities.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model shows a performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it's somewhat effective. However, the data entropy is low, suggesting the data is not very complex or varied, and the data life is short, implying limited long-term use. The market rating of 0.3 suggests modest demand. Overall, while there is potential, the combined factors suggest a lower valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1945.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2000. This price reflects the potential value of the data product, considering its performance improvement and the demand in the market, despite some limitations. I believe this starting point sets a strong foundation for our negotiation.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1900. While I appreciate your offer of 2000, I believe my price better reflects the limitations and current market demand for the data product. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1950. I believe this price better reflects the balance between the product's potential and current market demand, allowing us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1940. I believe this price strikes a balance between the seller's valuation and my budget, reflecting the product's potential while still allowing for a reasonable compromise. Let's move forward with this negotiation.
