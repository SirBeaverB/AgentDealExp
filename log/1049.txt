Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance, which could be attractive to potential users. However, the absence of data on entropy, life, and market limits the overall assessment. Still, the existing performance improvement and adequate capacity suggest a moderate value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate increase in performance, which can be appealing to potential clients. The market value of 0.5 suggests there is some demand for this product, despite its short data life and medium entropy. Since the capacity is deemed sufficient, this product can still serve a market need, albeit with some limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
