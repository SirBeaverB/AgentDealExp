Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which indicates it can handle the required data inputs or processing needs. However, the short data life implies that it may not provide long-term value, which could limit its overall market potential. Given the lack of information in several critical traits, such as Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy, the valuation remains cautious.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates a potential for enhancing existing models. The capacity is deemed "enough," suggesting that it can handle the required data load. However, the medium data entropy and short data life imply that while the product can still be useful, it may have limitations in longevity and consistency. The market score of 0.3 suggests a relatively low demand, impacting overall value. These factors combined lead to a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
