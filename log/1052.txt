Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable to users looking for efficiency gains. The market score of 0.5 suggests a reasonable demand, but the lack of data entropy and history means the product may not have enough context or proven reliability. Given these factors, the product is moderately priced, reflecting its potential but also its uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can attract buyers looking for improvements in their data products. The medium data entropy suggests that the data quality is acceptable, and the "enough" capacity means it can handle a decent workload. However, the short data life implies that the product may not be valuable for long-term use, which reduces its overall worth. The market score of 0.5 indicates a reasonable demand but not overwhelming interest. Considering all these factors, I estimate a price that reflects both the potential and limitations of the product.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
