Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': 'The product has a market score of 0.5, indicating a moderate demand, but the lack of detailed traits (all NULL except for market) makes it difficult to assess its true value or potential. This suggests a lower price point due to uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. However, the lack of available data on capacity, data entropy, and data history limits the confidence in the valuation. The short data life suggests it may not provide long-term value, but the market score of 0.5 indicates a moderate demand. Overall, the expected price reflects a balance between these factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
