{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 0.3), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'low'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The product exhibits a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it has the potential to enhance performance significantly. The capacity is deemed sufficient, and the low data entropy suggests that the data is well-structured and reliable. Additionally, a long data life implies ongoing utility. However, the NULL history may limit insights into previous performance, which could affect buyer confidence. The market score of 0.4 indicates there is some demand for such products, but not overwhelming. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a reasonable valuation, but the uncertainty from the NULL history tempers confidence.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
