Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.2 indicates a significant enhancement in performance, which can add considerable value, especially if the target market is receptive (0.5). However, the lack of data on capacity, entropy, and history limits the ability to fully assess the product's potential. The long data life is positive, suggesting longevity, but the uncertainty from NULL traits affects the overall valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.2 suggests a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing in a competitive market. However, the NULL values for capacity and data entropy limit the overall assessment of the product's capabilities. The long data life indicates potential longevity in usefulness, while the market value of 0.5 suggests some demand but not overwhelming. Overall, the product shows potential but lacks critical information for a higher valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:750.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 700. This price reflects the potential of the data product, considering the moderate enhancement in performance and its long data life. While there are some limitations due to NULL values, I believe the product's overall capabilities warrant a higher starting point.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 800. This price reflects my recognition of the improvements in performance and the long data life, while still considering the limitations presented by NULL values. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 750. This price reflects the significant potential of the data product and its long data life, while also considering the acknowledged limitations due to NULL values. It strikes a balance between both of our previous offers and opens the door for fruitful negotiation.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 750. This price reflects the significant potential of the data product and its long data life, while also considering the acknowledged limitations due to NULL values. It represents a fair compromise, encouraging us to move forward in our negotiations.
