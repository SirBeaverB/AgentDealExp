Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life and sufficient capacity, which suggests it can be useful in the market for a decent period. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, History, and Market limits the confidence in its overall value. That said, the expected price reflects a moderate valuation based on the available traits.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in predictive capabilities, which can be appealing to businesses looking to optimize their operations. The low data entropy suggests that the data is reliable and consistent, while the medium data life indicates that it can still provide value for a reasonable period. However, the lack of historical data makes it challenging to fully assess the product's track record, which slightly lowers the valuation. The market demand of 0.4 suggests there is some interest, but not overwhelming, which further supports a conservative price point.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
