Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and medium data entropy, indicating it can handle a moderate amount of data variability. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement and Data Life, along with a low market value of 0.3, suggests that its potential is limited. Therefore, the expected price reflects a cautious valuation based on the available traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a significant enhancement, which can add substantial value, especially in competitive markets. The capacity is noted as "enough," suggesting that the product can handle demand effectively. Despite the medium data entropy and long data life, the lack of history may limit the product\'s reliability perception. However, the market condition score of 0.3 indicates some level of demand. Overall, these factors contribute to a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
