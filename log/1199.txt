Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it has the potential to enhance performance, which is valuable to users. However, the high data entropy and short data life suggest limitations in terms of sustainability and long-term utility. The NULL data points regarding history and market make it difficult to assess demand accurately, which lowers the confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates it can enhance performance to some extent. The capacity is sufficient, but the high data entropy suggests that the data is complex and may require significant processing. However, the short data life could limit its usefulness over time. The market score of 0.5 reflects a balanced demand, indicating some interest in this type of product. Overall, while there are limitations, the product has valuable traits that could attract buyers, leading to a moderate pricing.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
