Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': "The lack of key traits significantly limits the ability to assess the product's value accurately. However, the market score of 0.5 indicates a moderate level of interest or demand, suggesting that it may still have some value in a niche area. A conservative price reflects the uncertainty and missing information.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing to potential users. However, the data life being short and several NULL traits limit the long-term value and insights available from this product. The market score of 0.5 suggests there is some demand, but not overwhelmingly strong. Therefore, while there's potential value, it is not robust enough to command a high price.", 'confidence': 'low'}
