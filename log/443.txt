Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate increase in performance, which can be valuable in a competitive landscape. However, the short data life and the lack of additional context (like market size and history) suggest limited long-term utility. Given these factors, a conservative price reflects potential while accounting for uncertainty due to NULL traits.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The product exhibits a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates a moderate enhancement in performance. The capacity is sufficient for usage, and low data entropy suggests that the data is clean and reliable. However, the short data life may limit the product's longevity and usefulness over time. The market value of 0.3 suggests a relatively low demand, but the other positive traits can still justify a modest price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
