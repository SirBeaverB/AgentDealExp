Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "While many traits are NULL, the product has sufficient capacity, which indicates it can handle a reasonable amount of data. This suggests potential utility, but the lack of information on performance improvement, data entropy, and market dynamics limits the product's attractiveness. Given these factors, a moderate price reflects its uncertain value.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 is a positive indicator of the product's effectiveness, while a low data entropy suggests the data is stable and reliable. The long data life also adds value, indicating potential longevity and usability in various applications. However, the market score of 0.5 suggests moderate demand. Overall, the combination of traits supports a reasonable valuation despite the lack of historical data.", 'confidence': 'high'}
Deal Price:1740.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the high Model Performance Improvement and the reliability of the data, suggesting substantial value for potential users. The long data life further enhances its appeal, making it a worthwhile investment.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1700. While I appreciate the seller's perspective on the value of model performance improvement and reliability, the overall lack of information on performance enhancement and market dynamics compels me to propose a more modest price. This adjustment reflects my cautious approach towards the product's uncertain value.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1750. This price reflects the high value of the data product, balancing my confidence in its superior performance and your cautious approach. Let's find common ground and move forward.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1725. This price reflects my recognition of the seller's confidence in the product's value while still maintaining a cautious approach due to the need for more information on performance and market dynamics. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1750. The product's high performance and reliability warrant a solid price, and this aligns closely with the buyer's recent offer, which shows they recognize its value as well. Let¡¯s move towards closing this deal.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1730. The seller's recent offer of 1750 demonstrates their confidence in the product's value, but I believe we can find a middle ground that still respects its high performance and reliability while being mindful of my budget constraints. Let's work towards a deal that satisfies us both.
