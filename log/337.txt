Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle existing demands, but many key traits are NULL. This uncertainty limits its potential, but it still has value due to its capacity.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. The capacity is sufficient, which means it can handle the demands of users. However, high data entropy suggests variability and complexity in the data, which may impact usability. Medium data life indicates that the data will remain relevant for a reasonable period, but the lack of historical performance data (NULL) raises some concerns about reliability. The market score of 0.3 is low, indicating limited demand. Overall, this product has potential but also significant limitations, justifying a moderate price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
