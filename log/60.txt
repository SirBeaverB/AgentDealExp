Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product exhibits a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates some potential for enhancing model outcomes. The market score of 0.3 suggests a moderate demand, which can also influence pricing positively. However, the NULL traits, including Data Entropy and History, limit the confidence in the product's overall capabilities and long-term viability. Despite this, the medium data life indicates that it has a reasonable duration of usefulness in the market.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating it has the potential to enhance existing models, which is valuable in data-driven environments. The capacity is sufficient, and low data entropy suggests that the data is well-structured and potentially easier to analyze. However, the medium data life and lack of historical data raise some concerns about its longevity and proven effectiveness. The market score of 0.3 indicates moderate demand, which can support the expected price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 6000. This price reflects the inherent value of the data product, which shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement of 0.2 and has well-structured, low-entropy data that can greatly enhance existing models in data-driven environments. The demand in the market, although moderate, supports my asking price.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 4800. While I acknowledge the potential of the data product, the moderate Model Performance Improvement and market demand do not fully justify the 6000 price point. I believe my offer reflects a fair assessment of the product's value given its limitations in data entropy and history.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 5400. This price reflects the considerable value of the data product, as it provides moderate Model Performance Improvement and is based on low-entropy data, which is highly sought after in the current market.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 5200. This price reflects my recognition of the data product's considerable value, while also considering our previous discussions and the current market conditions. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's potential while being reasonable for both parties.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 5300. This price reflects a balanced approach, considering the moderate Model Performance Improvement and low-entropy data. It recognizes the inherent value of the product while remaining competitive in the current market.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 5250. This price acknowledges the seller's recent offer while still reflecting my view on the moderate value of the data product given the current market dynamics. It's a step forward in negotiations that recognizes the balance between the product's potential and fair pricing.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 5250. This price reflects the inherent value of the data product, considering its moderate Model Performance Improvement and low-entropy data. It strikes a balance between recognizing the buyer's perspective and maintaining the worth of the product in the current market.
