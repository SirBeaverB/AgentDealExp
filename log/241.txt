Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle the necessary data requirements. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market creates uncertainty about its overall effectiveness and market demand. Therefore, while it has some value, it is limited due to the missing information.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating it can enhance existing models to some extent. The medium data entropy suggests a balanced level of unpredictability in the data, which can be valuable for certain applications. Additionally, having a long data life implies that the data will remain relevant for an extended period, enhancing its value. The market value of 0.3 indicates a fair level of demand, but the lack of historical data limits the confidence in the product's performance. Overall, considering these factors, I expect the price to be around 2500.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
