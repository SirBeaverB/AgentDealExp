Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a decent enhancement in the model's performance, which is valuable in data-driven industries. However, the lack of information on Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market limits the context for a more robust valuation. Given that there is enough capacity, it suggests that the product can be utilized effectively, but the unknown traits introduce uncertainty. Therefore, a moderate price reflects these considerations.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product exhibits a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, and the data capacity is sufficient for practical applications. The low data entropy suggests the data is of good quality and can be reliably used. Additionally, the long data life implies it will remain relevant for a significant period. However, the market score of 0.3 suggests limited demand or size, and the absence of historical data reduces confidence in the product's established effectiveness. Overall, the product has potential but is constrained by market factors and lack of historical context.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
