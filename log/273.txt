Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'While several traits are NULL, the product does have enough capacity, which indicates it can handle a reasonable amount of data. However, the lack of information on performance improvement, data entropy, data life, history, and market limits the confidence in this valuation. Given these factors, a moderate price is justified based on the potential utility of the product.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating it can add value in terms of performance enhancement. Additionally, it has enough capacity and a long data life, suggesting it can be effectively utilized over time. The medium data entropy implies that while the data is somewhat complex, it is manageable. The market score of 0.5 suggests a moderate demand, which can sustain a reasonable price point. However, the lack of historical data limits confidence in long-term value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
