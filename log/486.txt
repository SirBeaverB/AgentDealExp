Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and low data entropy, which indicates it can deliver stable and reliable results. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement and Data Life limits its potential value. The market score of 0.3 suggests a moderate demand, which supports a reasonable valuation but not a high price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive in various applications. The capacity being described as "enough" suggests that the product can handle current demands. However, the low data entropy implies a level of predictability and reliability in the data, which is beneficial. The medium data life suggests that the product can be useful for a reasonable timeframe. The market score of 0.3 indicates a moderate demand, which should be factored into the pricing. Given these evaluations, the expected price reflects the overall value of the product considering its performance and market demand.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
