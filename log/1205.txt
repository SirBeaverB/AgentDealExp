Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and high data entropy, which suggests it can handle complex data and provide valuable insights. However, the lack of information on model performance, data life, and market limits the potential valuation. Given these circumstances, a mid-range price is reasonable.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product demonstrates a reasonable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating potential effectiveness in enhancing model outputs. The capacity is deemed sufficient, which suggests it can handle the workload. However, the high data entropy implies a complex data structure that may require advanced techniques for effective utilization. The medium data life suggests that the data might not be the freshest, possibly affecting its long-term relevance. The market score of 0.3 indicates limited demand, which could suppress the price. Overall, while there are strengths, the presence of high data entropy and a low market score tempers the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
