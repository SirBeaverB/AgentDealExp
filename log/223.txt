Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 and has sufficient capacity. However, the medium data entropy and medium data life suggest average quality, while the lack of historical and market data limits the overall confidence in its value. The expected price reflects a balance between the moderate performance and the uncertainty due to missing information.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a decent model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it can enhance existing models to a certain extent. The capacity is sufficient and the market score of 0.4 suggests there is a moderate demand for such a product. However, the medium data entropy and medium data life indicate some potential limitations in the quality and longevity of the data. The lack of historical data could also be a drawback, but overall, the combination of these traits suggests a reasonable value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
