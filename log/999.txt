Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity, low data entropy, and a long data life, which suggests it can be useful and reliable over time. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement and market conditions limits its full potential valuation. Given these factors, a moderate price is justified.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to potential buyers. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle the required data load, and low data entropy is beneficial for data quality and usability. The long data life is a positive trait, indicating that the data remains relevant for an extended period. However, the market score of 0.5 suggests moderate demand. The absence of a historical performance record could limit the perceived value. Overall, these factors indicate a reasonable expected valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
