Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in the model\'s effectiveness, which can be valuable to potential users. The "enough" capacity suggests that the product can handle a reasonable amount of data, making it suitable for various applications. However, the absence of data entropy, history, and market information limits the confidence in the valuation as these metrics often provide critical insights into the product\'s reliability and market positioning. Given these factors, a conservative estimate of 15000 reflects the product\'s potential while accounting for the uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates that the product can enhance performance, which is a significant selling point. The market size of 0.3 suggests there is some demand for this type of data product, even though the data entropy and life are only medium. The lack of historical performance data introduces some uncertainty, but the available traits still provide a foundation for a reasonable valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
