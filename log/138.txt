Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': 'The market score is 0.5, indicating a low demand or presence in the market. Given that most key traits are NULL, there is insufficient data to justify a higher price. The expected price reflects a minimal entry point for a product with unclear performance metrics and limited market validation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 is a positive indicator of the product's effectiveness, suggesting it can enhance existing models. Additionally, a long data life implies sustained relevance and utility. However, the NULL values for capacity and data entropy limit the understanding of the product's full potential, leading to a moderate market score of 0.5. The combination of these factors suggests a reasonable expected price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
