Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a low data entropy, indicating that the data is structured and less complex, which can be advantageous for users looking for reliable insights. Additionally, the capacity is sufficient, suggesting it can handle the required workload. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data life, history, and market limits the confidence in the valuation. Given the low entropy and adequate capacity, a moderate price is justified.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing to potential buyers. However, the low data entropy suggests that the data is less complex and may not provide significant insights. The short data life limits the longevity of the product's utility. The market demand of 0.5 shows potential, but the lack of historical data makes it difficult to assess the product's effectiveness over time. Overall, the product has some value, but the limitations prevent a higher valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
