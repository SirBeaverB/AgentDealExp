Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a notable enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in the market context where the demand is 0.5. However, the lack of data on capacity, data entropy, data life, and history suggests uncertainty about the product's overall capabilities and long-term viability. This leads to a moderate valuation reflecting the potential benefits of the MPI and market demand, but tempered by the missing information.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing in the market. However, the short data life and the presence of NULL traits limit the overall value. The market score of 0.5 suggests a fair demand but not overwhelming interest. Therefore, the expected price reflects a balance of these factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
