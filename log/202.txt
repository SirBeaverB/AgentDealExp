Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The market score of 0.4 suggests a moderate demand for the product, but the lack of specific performance metrics and other critical traits indicates uncertainty in its value. A price of 2000 reflects potential value while accounting for the missing information.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. However, the lack of information on capacity and data entropy limits the assessment of scalability and risk. The long data life suggests that the product can provide ongoing value over time. Combined with a market score of 0.4, there is potential demand, but the overall uncertainty due to NULL traits leads to a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
