Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 and a market score of 0.3, indicating some demand and potential value in specific niches. However, the lack of data on entrophy, life, and history introduces uncertainty, leading to a conservative valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product has a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating a reasonable enhancement in performance. The capacity is enough to handle demands, and while both data entropy and data life are at medium levels, they suggest a balanced quality. However, the market score of 0.3 points to a lower demand or competitive landscape, which might limit the product's value. Overall, the combination of traits suggests a fair price given the market context.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
