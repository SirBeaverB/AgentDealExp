Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has medium data entropy and sufficient capacity, suggesting it can handle a decent amount of data processing. However, the short data life implies limited long-term usability, and the NULL values for Model Performance Improvement and History indicate a lack of critical information that could enhance its value. The market score of 0.5 reflects moderate demand, which also contributes to a lower valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The product shows a decent Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it can enhance performance to some extent. The medium data entropy suggests that the data quality is reasonable, while the "enough" capacity implies it can handle the required workload. However, the short data life could limit its long-term usefulness and marketability. The market score of 0.5 suggests moderate demand, which balances out the overall value. Given these traits, the price reflects a product that has potential but also some limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
