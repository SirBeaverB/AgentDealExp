{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 0.3), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'low'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it can enhance performance to some extent. The capacity is sufficient, and the data life is long, which suggests that the product can be used effectively over time. However, the low data entropy indicates that the data is of high quality and reliability. The lack of historical data and market information introduces uncertainty, but the other traits still suggest a reasonable value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product shows a strong model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates it can significantly enhance the performance of existing systems. The capacity is sufficient, and it has a long data life, suggesting durability and relevance over time. However, the low data entropy indicates that the data may not be highly diverse or rich, which could limit its applicability in certain scenarios. The market score of 0.3 suggests a moderate demand, but the lack of historical data limits the overall confidence in predicting its success. Therefore, the expected price balances the potential benefits against the uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
