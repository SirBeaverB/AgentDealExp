Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The medium data life indicates that the product may have some relevance and usability in the market, even though several traits are unavailable. This suggests it could be valuable for specific applications or industries that require medium-term data usage. However, due to the lack of information on performance improvement, capacity, and market demand, the price is conservative.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable to potential users. The medium data life suggests relevance for a reasonable duration. However, the NULL traits indicate a lack of critical information, which limits the overall confidence in the valuation. Given the market score of 0.4, there is some demand, but the uncertainties reduce the potential price.', 'confidence': 'low'}
