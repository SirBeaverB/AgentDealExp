Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has adequate capacity and a market score of 0.4, indicating some level of demand, but the absence of key traits like Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy limits its potential value. Given these factors, a conservative price reflects the uncertain value while still accounting for the existing market interest.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating some value in enhancing performance. However, the low Data Entropy suggests the data is straightforward and may not offer significant insights. The Capacity being "enough" implies it can handle current demands, but the short Data Life and lack of historical data (NULL) raise concerns about its long-term usability. The market score of 0.4 indicates a moderate demand, but overall, the uncertainty due to NULL traits limits confidence in a higher valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate Model Performance Improvement and the potential value it could bring to your operations, despite the data's limitations. I believe this is a fair starting point given the market demand and the quality of the product.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. This price reflects my cautious assessment of the product's limitations and the moderate demand indicated by the market score. While I recognize the potential benefits, I believe a lower price is justified given the absence of key traits like Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. The product has shown some improvements, and I believe this price reflects its value while still being competitive in the current market.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price fairly reflects the moderate improvements you've mentioned while still considering the product's limitations and the current market conditions. It's a competitive offer that recognizes the value while allowing us to move closer to a deal.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1680. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the improvements in model performance while also acknowledging the product's limitations and current market conditions.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1670. This price acknowledges the seller's assessment of the improvements and market conditions while still reflecting my position on the value of the product. I believe it is a reasonable step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
