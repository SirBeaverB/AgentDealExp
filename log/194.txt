Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': 'The data product has a low market value of 0.3 and lacks critical information due to multiple NULL traits, which indicates limited potential for performance and utility. Therefore, the expected price reflects a very conservative estimate.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a decent level of enhancement, which could attract some buyers. However, the NULL values for Capacity, Data Entropy, and History suggest limited information about the product's overall capabilities and market applicability. The long Data Life is a positive aspect, but without sufficient data, the valuation remains cautious.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
