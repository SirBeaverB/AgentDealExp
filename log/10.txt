Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The market score of 0.4 indicates a moderate level of demand, but the lack of specific metrics related to model performance, capacity, data entropy, data life, and history makes it difficult to accurately assess the product's value. Given the uncertainty, a conservative price is suggested.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates that the product has some capability to enhance performance, which is appealing in a competitive market. However, the short data life and multiple NULL traits suggest limited reliability and potential longevity of the product. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, which, combined with the other factors, leads to a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
