Additionally, it has a long Data Life and low Data Entropy, suggesting it can be reliable and sustainable over time. However, the market score of 0.3 indicates limited demand, which lowers the valuation. The absence of historical data does introduce some uncertainty, but the overall traits suggest a solid product.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
