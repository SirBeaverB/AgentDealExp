Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has adequate capacity and medium data entropy, suggesting it can handle a reasonable amount of data and complexity. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data life, history, and market limits our assessment. The price reflects a moderate value considering the potential but uncertainty due to missing traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement over baseline performance, which can attract interest. However, the short data life and medium data entropy suggest that the product may not have long-term reliability or stability, which could limit its overall value. The market score of 0.3 implies a lower demand, affecting pricing negatively. These factors combined suggest a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
