Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in applications where model efficiency is critical. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle the required data without issues, adding to its usability. However, the high data entropy indicates complexity, which can be a double-edged sword; it may provide rich insights but could also complicate the data interpretation. The market score of 0.4 points to a moderate level of demand, but the lack of data life and history limits the confidence in long-term viability and user adoption. Overall, the product has potential value but is moderated by uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it can enhance performance effectively. The capacity being "enough" suggests it can handle a reasonable amount of data, while the high data entropy implies complexity and richness in the data. However, the medium data life and lack of historical data can limit its long-term value. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand. Overall, these factors suggest a fair value in the mid-range for similar data products.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the significant Model Performance Improvement of 0.2, indicating the data product's ability to enhance performance effectively. Additionally, the complexity and richness of the data, despite some limitations, contribute to its value. I believe this offer represents its true potential in the market.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1500. While I recognize the Model Performance Improvement of 0.2 and the complexity of the data, I believe the uncertainties regarding data life and history significantly impact the overall value. Given these factors, I am confident that 1500 is a fair starting point for negotiation.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. The data product boasts a significant Model Performance Improvement of 0.2, and I believe this price reflects its true value while addressing your concerns about data life and history. Let's bridge the gap and move forward.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1600. The seller's current offer of 1700 is close, but I still have concerns about the data's life and history. My offer reflects a fair consideration of those uncertainties while recognizing the value of the Model Performance Improvement. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1650. The data product's significant Model Performance Improvement of 0.2 and its complexity justify this price, providing a fair value while still addressing the buyer's concerns about data life and history.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1600. I believe this price represents a fair balance between the value of the data product's performance improvement and my concerns regarding its data life and history. It's a reasonable step towards closing this deal while still being mindful of the risks involved.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1675. This price reflects the high value of the data product due to its impressive model performance improvement and overall quality, while still considering the buyer's concerns about data life and history.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price reflects a fair balance considering the seller's emphasis on the data product's impressive model performance improvement while still addressing my concerns regarding the data's life and history.
Round 5 (Seller): I offer 1675. I believe this price reflects the exceptional value of the data product, highlighting its significant model performance improvement and quality. It's a fair price that balances the concerns regarding data life and history while recognizing the product's substantial benefits.
Round 5 (Buyer): I offer 1660. I believe this price acknowledges the seller's emphasis on the product's quality and model performance improvement while still addressing my concerns about data life and history. It's a reasonable compromise that reflects the value I see in the product without overcommitting.
