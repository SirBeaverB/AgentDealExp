Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and a medium level of data entropy, which suggests it can handle a reasonable amount of variability in data. However, the short data life might limit its long-term usability and value. The lack of information on model performance improvement and market dynamics makes it challenging to estimate a higher price, but the existing traits still indicate potential value in specific use cases.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate level of effectiveness, while the market score of 0.4 suggests some demand exists. However, the data life being short and the history being NULL may limit the long-term viability and reliability of the product. Therefore, the expected price reflects moderate value considering these factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
