Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The model shows a notable performance improvement (MPI of 0.2), which indicates that it can effectively enhance the outcomes of existing processes. However, the presence of high data entropy suggests that the data may be complex or less structured, which can impact usability. The lack of information regarding data life, history, and market limits confidence in the valuation. The expected price reflects a balance between the positive MPI and the uncertainty introduced by the NULL traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating some potential for enhancing model accuracy. The long data life suggests sustainable usability, while the high data entropy implies valuable insights can be derived from the data. However, the market score of 0.3 indicates limited demand or competition. Thus, the expected price reflects moderate potential and demand.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
