Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and a market rating of 0.5, indicating moderate demand. However, the lack of key traits such as Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy reduces its overall value. Given the market conditions and the available traits, a moderate price is justified.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The model shows a notable performance improvement (MPI of 0.2), indicating it can enhance outcomes or efficiency for users. The capacity is sufficient, suggesting it can handle the necessary data loads, while a medium data life indicates it can be applicable for a reasonable duration. Although data entropy is high, which may imply complexity and challenges, the market demand is moderate (0.5), suggesting potential value but not overwhelming. Given these traits, the product has a solid value proposition, though the lack of historical data limits its appeal somewhat.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
