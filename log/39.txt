{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable to users seeking to improve their data-driven decisions. However, the lack of information regarding capacity, data entropy, history, and market reduces the overall confidence in the product's value, suggesting a cautious valuation.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which suggests it has some capability to enhance performance. The market value of 0.4 indicates there is demand, but the presence of multiple NULL traits, particularly in capacity and data entropy, limits the product's overall appeal and usability. Given the medium data life, it could have some value but the uncertainty due to NULL traits affects confidence.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
