Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The product has sufficient capacity for use, but the short data life and the presence of several NULL traits limit its value. The market value of 0.4 indicates a moderate demand, suggesting that while there is some interest, the product's overall utility may not be high. Therefore, a price of 2000 reflects these limitations while still recognizing the potential for use.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates some potential benefit. Additionally, the market score of 0.4 suggests there is moderate demand. However, the short data life and low data entropy may limit its long-term value. Overall, the traits indicate a product with potential but also limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
