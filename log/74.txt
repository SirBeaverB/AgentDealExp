Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': 'The product has a low market value of 0.3 and lacks critical trait data, which suggests limited usability and appeal. With many traits being NULL, it indicates uncertainty about its performance and potential, leading to a conservative valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which is valuable in competitive markets. However, the lack of data on capacity, data entropy, and a short data life suggests limitations in the product's longevity and utility. The market score of 0.3 reflects a niche demand, which may also affect pricing. Overall, the product has potential but is constrained by several unknowns.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
