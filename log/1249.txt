Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which indicates that it can handle the necessary data load, but the lack of information on model performance improvement, data entropy, data life, history, and market makes it difficult to assess its full potential. Given the uncertainty due to multiple NULL traits, the price reflects a cautious valuation based on the minimal available information.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in capabilities, which can be attractive to buyers. The capacity is sufficient, and the data life is long, suggesting that the product will remain valuable over time. However, high data entropy might complicate usability or understanding of the data, which could reduce demand. The market score of 0.3 indicates limited market appeal. Overall, while the product has some positive traits, the high data entropy and low market score temper the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
