Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and sufficient capacity, which indicates it could provide value over time and handle a reasonable amount of data. However, the lack of information regarding model performance improvement, data entropy, history, and market limits the overall confidence in its potential value, suggesting a moderate price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it can enhance performance to a certain extent. The low Data Entropy suggests that the data is reliable and well-structured, while a long Data Life indicates sustained relevancy over time. Although the market score of 0.4 is relatively low, the combination of these factors suggests a product that has potential value, albeit not at a premium level. The absence of historical data limits the confidence in the product's performance in real-world scenarios.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
