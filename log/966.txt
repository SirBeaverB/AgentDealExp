Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'low'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a low data entropy which suggests that the data is clean and reliable. However, the market value is relatively low at 0.3, indicating limited demand. The capacity being "enough" is a positive trait, but the presence of several NULL traits suggests uncertainty in performance and longevity. Therefore, the expected price reflects a balance between the positive aspects and the lack of complete information.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it can enhance performance effectively. The capacity is sufficient, which is essential for scalability. The low Data Entropy suggests that the data is stable and predictable, which is favorable for users. Additionally, a long Data Life adds value as it implies the data can be utilized over an extended period. However, the market being at 0.3 indicates limited demand, which may cap the price. Overall, the combination of these traits suggests a moderate value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2500. This price reflects the moderate Model Performance Improvement of 0.3, the sufficient capacity for scalability, and the stable nature of the data indicated by low Data Entropy. The long Data Life also adds significant value, positioning this product as a highly effective solution for users looking for reliable data over time.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1300. The product has several NULL traits suggesting some uncertainty in its performance and longevity, which brings down its value.
