Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life and sufficient capacity, indicating it can handle a moderate amount of data effectively. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement and data entropy limits its appeal. The market rating of 0.5 suggests moderate demand, which supports a reasonable price point.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating a moderate enhancement in performance, which can attract interest. The low data entropy suggests that the data is consistent and reliable, making it more appealing for users. The medium data life indicates that the product can remain relevant for a decent period. However, the history being NULL and a market score of 0.5 indicates some uncertainty about its past success and competitive positioning. Overall, these factors contribute to a reasonable expectation of value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
