Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to certain businesses looking to optimize their models. However, the lack of data on entropy, life, history, and market limits the assessment of potential market demand and value. Given these constraints, a conservative price reflects the improvement while considering the uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The product shows a reasonable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates a notable enhancement in performance. The capacity is sufficient, suggesting it can handle demand. However, the market score of 0.3 is relatively low, signaling limited market interest or saturation. The medium data entropy and life suggest a balanced value in terms of complexity and usability. Overall, while the potential is there, the low market score and lack of historical data limit confidence in a higher valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
