Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to potential users. However, the data life being short and having medium data entropy suggests the product may not provide long-term value. The NULL history and market traits indicate a lack of market validation and demand assessment, which lowers confidence in the valuation. Despite these drawbacks, the expected price reflects the potential utility of the model performance improvement.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate improvement in model performance (MPI of 0.25) which suggests some effectiveness, and the market demand is decent at 0.5. However, the short data life and medium entropy indicate that the product may not be highly sustainable or robust in the long term. The lack of historical data further diminishes the confidence in its long-term value. Therefore, while it has some potential, the overall assessment is tempered by these factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2000. This price reflects the moderate improvement in model performance and decent market demand, indicating a valuable data product despite its limitations.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1900. The seller's price of 2000 is too high considering the short data life and medium data entropy, which suggest limited long-term value. I'm looking for a more reasonable price that reflects the actual potential of the product.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1950. The previous offer of 1900 was too low considering the moderate model performance and the reasonable market demand. This new price reflects the value of the data product while still being competitive in the market.

Round 5 (Buyer): I offer 1700. I believe this price better reflects the ongoing discussions and acknowledges the moderate model performance we've assessed while still aiming to provide value for both parties. It considers the previous offers and seeks to find a balance that is fair and reasonable in this negotiation.
