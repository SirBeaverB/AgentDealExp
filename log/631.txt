Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and medium data entropy and life, indicating it can provide valuable insights and utility to users. However, the NULL traits suggest there might be limitations in understanding its full potential and market fit. This leads to a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which suggests it can enhance existing models effectively. The medium data entropy and medium data life indicate decent quality and relevance of the data, while the "enough" capacity suggests it can support substantial use cases. However, the market value is relatively low at 0.3, which may reflect limited demand or competition. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a reasonable valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
