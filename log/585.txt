Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable to users looking to improve their models. However, the lack of information on data entropy, data life, history, and market conditions significantly limits the overall assessment. Given the positive MPI, I estimate a reasonable value but temper it due to the missing traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can attract interest from users looking for improved models. However, the medium data entropy and short data life suggest that while the product has the potential to be useful, its value may be limited by the longevity and reliability of the data. The market rating of 0.3 indicates a lower overall demand, affecting the pricing negatively. Overall, the product has some attractive features, but the limitations keep the expected price relatively modest.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the potential of the data product, given its moderate Model Performance Improvement and the interest it can generate among users seeking enhanced models. Despite some limitations, the product has valuable features that justify this higher asking price.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. While I recognize the potential of the data product, the price you've set is quite a stretch considering the significant limitations and missing information on data entropy, life, and market conditions. My offer reflects a more cautious valuation given these factors.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. This price reflects the inherent value of the data product while also considering the limitations mentioned. It's a fair compromise that acknowledges both the potential and the concerns raised. Let's move forward.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price strikes a balance between recognizing the seller's valuation while still addressing the significant limitations that the data product has. It's a reasonable step forward that can help us both move toward a successful agreement.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1680. This price reflects the value of the data product while considering the buyer's feedback on its limitations. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both the potential and the concerns raised.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1670. This price acknowledges the seller's latest offer while still reflecting the concerns regarding the limitations of the data product. I believe it is a reasonable compromise that moves us closer to an agreement.
