Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it can enhance model performance effectively. However, the high data entropy suggests that the data might be complex and less structured, which can limit usability. The lack of information on Data Life, History, and Market reduces confidence in demand and longevity of the product. Given these factors, the price reflects potential but also uncertainty in its application.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be attractive for users looking to optimize their data products. The capacity is sufficient, suggesting reliability in handling data. High data entropy may imply that the data is diverse and complex, which can be valuable for certain applications. However, the medium data life indicates that the data might not be extremely current or long-lasting, which slightly detracts from its value. The market value of 0.5 suggests a decent demand for the product, supporting a reasonable price point. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a moderate expected price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
