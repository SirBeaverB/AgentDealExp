Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 and a market value of 0.4 indicate some potential for the product, suggesting it can enhance existing models moderately well. However, the lack of data on capacity, entropy, life, and history limits the understanding of its full utility and market applicability. Given these factors, a moderate price reflects its potential while accounting for uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25 suggests a moderate enhancement in efficiency or effectiveness, which can be appealing in competitive markets. However, the short data life and the absence of capacity, data entropy, and history raise concerns about the product's long-term value and reliability. The market value of 0.4 indicates a moderate demand, but the uncertainties associated with the NULL traits limit the product's potential appeal.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Deal Price:1750.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in efficiency suggested by the model performance improvement, while also accounting for the uncertainties regarding the product's long-term value.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1700. This price takes into account the moderate potential of the product based on the model performance improvement, while also reflecting the uncertainties associated with its capacity and history.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1750. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the offers made in the previous round, taking into account the moderate efficiency improvements and long-term uncertainties. This ensures we both benefit from the deal while acknowledging the current market dynamics.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1750. I believe this price effectively balances the varying perspectives on efficiency improvements and uncertainties, positioning us for a mutually advantageous agreement while being aligned with market trends. Let's move forward with this constructive approach.
