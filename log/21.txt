{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'low'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and low data entropy, which suggests it can provide reliable outputs and insights. However, the absence of critical traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Data Life, History, and Market limits the ability to fully assess its value. The price reflects a moderate value based on its existing strengths.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate increase in performance, which can be appealing to users looking to enhance their existing systems. However, the data entropy is low, suggesting that the data is not very complex or rich, which could limit its applications. The short data life implies that the data may not be useful for long-term projects, but the market score of 0.4 indicates a moderate demand. Overall, while there is some value, the limitations of the short data life and low complexity suggest a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the potential of the data product to enhance system performance, despite its limitations. The moderate increase in performance and the market demand suggest that this product has significant value, and I believe it warrants a higher starting point in our negotiation.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1500. While I acknowledge the potential of the data product, its limitations and the absence of critical traits significantly lower its perceived value. Therefore, my offer reflects a more cautious approach to its actual worth.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1600. This price reflects the value of the data product while also considering the limitations that were previously discussed. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both the potential benefits and the constraints of the offering.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1550. This price recognizes the seller's valuation while also considering the limitations discussed. I believe it strikes a balance between our positions and keeps the negotiation moving forward.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1580. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, acknowledging the potential value of the data product while also considering its limitations. Let's move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1560. This price acknowledges the seller's perspective while still reflecting my valuation of the data product's potential. I believe this is a fair step towards reaching an agreement that benefits both parties.
