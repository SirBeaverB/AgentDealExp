{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a decent Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 and has a market demand rating of 0.4, indicating some level of interest in the product. However, the medium data entropy and medium data life suggest that while the product is usable, it may not be cutting-edge or have long-term viability. The NULL history trait indicates a lack of past performance data, which limits the confidence level in the valuation, but the overall characteristics suggest a moderate value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 suggests a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive in competitive markets. The market value of 0.4 indicates a reasonable demand for such a product, despite having a medium data entropy and life. However, the lack of historical data limits the confidence in the product's long-term effectiveness and acceptance. Therefore, the pricing reflects a balance between the potential of the product and the uncertainties due to the missing historical context.", 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in performance indicated by the Model Performance Improvement and the reasonable market demand for the product. Given the unique qualities of this data product, I believe this price represents its full value in a competitive market.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400. While I recognize the seller's perspective on the product's performance and market demand, I believe my offer reflects the moderate characteristics of the data product, including its medium data entropy and life. This price aligns more closely with its current usability and the uncertainty due to the NULL history trait.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1600. The product has shown promising performance and there is a rising demand in the market, which justifies a higher price than my previous offer. This new price reflects a balanced approach considering its moderate characteristics and the uncertainties involved.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1500. The product's performance and market demand are indeed compelling, and while I acknowledge the seller's rationale for a higher price, I believe my offer reflects a reasonable compromise considering both the product's potential and the seller's previous price points.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1550. The product has shown consistent performance, and I believe this price reflects both its potential and the market dynamics we're facing. Let's find common ground here.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1500. The product certainly has potential and consistent performance, but I believe a price of 1500 strikes a fair balance considering market dynamics and the previous discussions we've had. Let's work together to reach an agreement.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1550. I believe this price reflects the product's value, considering its consistent performance and the positive market dynamics we've discussed. It's a fair middle ground that acknowledges both the buyer's interest and the product's characteristics.
