Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': 'The absence of key traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market suggests that the product lacks substantial information to assess its value accurately. In a market where data products typically rely on measurable performance and market demand, the lack of details leads to a lower valuation. Hence, a nominal price is suggested.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which could attract some interest in niche markets. However, the lack of information regarding capacity, data entropy, and a short data life limits the overall value. The market score of 0.3 suggests low demand and competition, further impacting price. Thus, a conservative estimate is warranted.', 'confidence': 'low'}
