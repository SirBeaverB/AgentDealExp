Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life and sufficient capacity, indicating it can serve a moderate market demand. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement and data entropy suggests uncertainty in its effectiveness, which limits the potential price. The market score of 0.4 indicates a low to moderate demand for the product.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product has a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating that it can provide a noticeable enhancement in performance, which is valuable in a competitive market. The market score of 0.4 suggests there is some demand for this type of product, but it is not particularly strong. The low data entropy indicates that the data is relatively stable and reliable, which adds to the product's value. However, the medium data life and lack of historical data may limit the product's potential lifespan and applicability in the market. Overall, the combination of these traits supports a moderate valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
