Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The data product has a long data life, indicating that it can be valuable over an extended period. However, the NULL values for Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, and History limit the confidence in its overall value. The market score of 0.5 suggests moderate demand, which supports a reasonable price despite the uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model efficiency, which can be attractive in competitive markets. The long data life suggests that the product could provide lasting value, and while the market score of 0.5 indicates a medium level of demand, the absence of several traits (especially capacity and data entropy) limits the overall confidence in its full potential. Thus, a cautious valuation is warranted.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
