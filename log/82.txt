Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and a market demand rating of 0.5, indicating a moderate level of interest. However, the lack of data on model performance improvement, data entropy, data life, and history raises concerns about its reliability and effectiveness. This combination suggests a lower valuation compared to products with more comprehensive data.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it can enhance existing models to some extent. The capacity is deemed "enough," suggesting it can handle the required data volume efficiently. With low data entropy, the data is likely to be consistent and reliable, which is a positive trait for potential users. However, the medium data life could limit its long-term value, and the market score of 0.5 indicates a moderate demand. Overall, the combination of these traits suggests a reasonable price point, but the lack of historical data limits confidence.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
