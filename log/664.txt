{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The data product has a medium capacity and medium data entropy, indicating a reasonable level of quality and usability. However, the NULL values for Model Performance Improvement and History suggest that there's uncertainty about its effectiveness and track record. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, which further supports a conservative valuation. Overall, the product has potential but lacks some key performance indicators, leading to a cautious price estimate.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a reasonable enhancement that can attract users looking for better performance. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle the necessary data load, and a medium data entropy along with a medium data life implies a decent balance between performance and longevity. However, the lack of historical data may limit confidence in sustained performance over time. The market score of 0.5 reflects moderate demand, suggesting that while the product is viable, it may not be a top-tier solution.', 'confidence': '70'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2000. This price reflects the significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates a clear enhancement in performance that will attract users. The product's capacity is sufficient for necessary data loads, and its medium data entropy and life suggest a solid balance between performance and longevity. Given these factors, I am confident in the value of this data product.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400. Given the medium capacity and data entropy, along with the uncertainty regarding the Model Performance Improvement and the market score of 0.5, I believe a more conservative price is appropriate for this product.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1600. I believe this price reflects a fair balance considering the medium capacity and the market score, while still recognizing the buyer's interest in product longevity and performance improvements. This is a competitive offer that invites further negotiation.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1500. I believe this price acknowledges the seller's recent offer of 1600 while also reflecting the value I place on the product's longevity and performance improvements. This adjustment shows my willingness to negotiate and find common ground, ensuring a win-win situation for both parties.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1550. This price reflects a balanced consideration of the product's medium capacity and the market's ongoing demand while still acknowledging the buyer's previous offer of 1500. Let's work toward a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1540. This price reflects my appreciation for the seller's consideration of the product's medium capacity and ongoing market demand, while still aiming for a competitive agreement that aligns with my previous offers. Let's find a common ground that works for both of us.
