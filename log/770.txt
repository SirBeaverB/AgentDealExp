Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has a sufficient capacity and a market score of 0.3, indicating some demand, but the lack of data on Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, Data Life, and History limits its overall value. The price reflects a cautious estimate based on available information.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate improvement potential, which is valuable, especially in competitive markets. The capacity is sufficient, and while the data entropy is high (which suggests the data is complex and potentially valuable), the medium data life indicates some limitations in longevity. The market value of 0.3 suggests a moderate demand. Given these factors, the price reflects a balanced assessment of potential and limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 8000. This price reflects the data product's moderate improvement potential as indicated by the Model Performance Improvement of 0.25, alongside its complex high entropy, which adds to its value in a competitive market.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1500. The significant gap between my valuation and your initial offer suggests that while the data product has potential, the lack of crucial performance metrics and the high entropy leads me to a much more cautious price point. I believe this is a fair starting position for both of us to negotiate further.
