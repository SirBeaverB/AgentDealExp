Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a significant enhancement in performance, which can attract buyers looking for efficiency and effectiveness in data products. However, the high data entropy suggests that the data may be complex or less structured, which could limit its immediate usability. The lack of data life, history, and market information creates uncertainty around the product's reliability and market positioning. Therefore, while the MPI adds value, the unknown aspects temper the overall confidence in the valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a significant enhancement in performance, which is attractive to potential buyers. The capacity is stated as "enough," suggesting that the product can handle demand without limitations. However, the high data entropy suggests variability in the data, which may require additional handling or processing. The medium data life indicates it has a reasonable timeframe for relevance, but the lack of historical data could raise concerns about reliability and long-term viability. Given the market demand is at 0.3, there is moderate interest in such products. Considering these factors, the expected price reflects a balance between its strengths in performance and capacity against the uncertainties presented by its data characteristics.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
