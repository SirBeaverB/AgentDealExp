Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data entropy and sufficient capacity, indicating a decent level of complexity and usability. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement and data life limits its potential effectiveness and longevity. The market value of 0.5 suggests moderate interest or demand for this type of product, which supports a conservative pricing strategy.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant improvement in model performance (MPI of 0.25), indicating a potential for enhanced effectiveness in its application. The "enough" capacity suggests it can handle existing demands, and a "long" data life implies longevity and relevance in the market. However, the medium data entropy could indicate a moderate level of complexity or variability in the data, which might affect usability. The market score of 0.5 suggests a moderate demand. Overall, these factors suggest that the product is valuable, but the lack of historical data (NULL) limits confidence.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
