Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be appealing to users looking to improve their data-driven decision-making. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle a reasonable amount of data, while low data entropy implies a reliable and consistent dataset. However, the medium data life and the absence of historical and market data introduce some uncertainty. Therefore, while there is potential value, the lack of comprehensive information limits the confidence in this valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing for potential users. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle current data needs efficiently, while a low data entropy implies that the data is consistent and reliable. Although the data life is only medium and there is a lack of historical data, the market score of 0.4 shows there is some demand for this type of product. Therefore, the product has a reasonable value in a niche market.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
