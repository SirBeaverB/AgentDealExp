Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The product has a high data entropy, indicating that it contains diverse and potentially valuable information. However, the short data life and lack of model performance improvement suggest that its utility may be limited over time. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, which contributes to the pricing. Overall, the expected price reflects the product's potential value against its limitations.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) at 0.25, which indicates it can provide some enhancement in performance. However, the high data entropy suggests that the data may be complex or less structured, potentially limiting its usability. The short data life indicates that the relevance of the data may decrease quickly, which can affect its long-term value. Despite these concerns, the market score of 0.4 suggests there is some demand, which helps support a reasonable price point.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
