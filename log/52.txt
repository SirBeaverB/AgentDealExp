Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The long data life indicates that the product has enduring relevance and potential for ongoing use, which can be valuable in the market. However, the NULL traits limit the ability to fully assess its performance and capacity, leading to a moderate valuation. The market score of 0.3 suggests that there is some demand, but likely not a high level, which also tempers the price.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a modest improvement in performance, which can be valuable in specific contexts, especially in a competitive market with a demand rating of 0.3. However, the lack of capacity and data entropy information limits the overall understanding of the product's robustness and applicability. The long data life adds some value, but due to several NULL traits, the expected price is conservative.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
