Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product has enough capacity and a medium data life, indicating it's suitable for ongoing use. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data entropy, and history limits confidence in its effectiveness. The market score of 0.3 suggests there is a low to moderate demand, which impacts the overall valuation. Thus, the price reflects a balance between potential utility and the uncertainty of the missing data.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.2 indicates a decent enhancement in capabilities, while low data entropy suggests that the data used is reliable and well-structured. However, the market score of 0.3 indicates limited demand or market size, which could hinder higher valuations. The medium data life suggests usability over a reasonable time frame, but the lack of historical data reduces confidence in the product's long-term viability. Overall, these factors balance each other, leading to a moderate expected price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
