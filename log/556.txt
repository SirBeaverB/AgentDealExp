Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a reasonable enhancement in model accuracy or efficiency, which can be highly valuable in data-driven industries. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle a significant volume of data, making it suitable for various applications. The long data life implies that the product can be utilized over an extended period, adding to its value. However, the NULL traits (Data Entropy and History) indicate some gaps in information, which could limit marketability to some extent. The market score of 0.4 suggests a moderate demand. Overall, considering these factors, the expected price reflects its potential utility while accounting for the uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a significant model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing outcomes. The low data entropy suggests that the data is reliable and easy to work with, while a long data life implies that it can be utilized for an extended period, adding to its value. The market score of 0.4 indicates a reasonable demand. However, the absence of historical data weakens the overall validation of the product's performance in real-world applications.", 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the significant model performance improvement of the data product, which enhances outcomes effectively. Additionally, the low data entropy indicates its reliability and usability, while the long data life adds substantial value.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1500. While the model performance improvement is notable, the low data entropy raises concerns about the completeness of the information, affecting its overall marketability. My offer reflects the need to account for these uncertainties while still valuing the data product's potential utility.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. The data product has demonstrated significant potential, and I believe this price reflects its true value, considering the improvements in performance and reliability.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1600. The data product does show promise, but I still have concerns regarding the data completeness and overall marketability. I believe this price is a fair reflection of its current state while allowing room for negotiation.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1650. I believe this price reflects the substantial value of the data product while addressing some of the concerns raised about data completeness. This amount strikes a balance between our previous discussions and keeps the negotiation moving forward.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1600. I believe this price acknowledges the value of the data product while also reflecting my concerns regarding its completeness and marketability. This allows us to make progress and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1675. The value of the data product is significant, reflecting its performance improvements and reliability, while I want to remain competitive in this negotiation.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 1650. The data product holds promise, but I believe the concerns regarding completeness and marketability still warrant a more cautious approach to pricing. This offer reflects my confidence in its potential while also considering the seller's hesitations. Let's find a middle ground that recognizes both value and the need for clarity.
Round 5 (Seller): I offer 1660. I believe this price reflects the significant potential of the data product while also addressing the concerns about completeness and marketability that have been raised in our discussions. Let's find a middle ground that acknowledges the value of this product.
Round 5 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price strikes a fair balance between the value of the data product and the concerns about its completeness and marketability. It acknowledges the potential while still being mindful of the issues we've discussed. Let's work towards a resolution that reflects both parties' interests.
