Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product exhibits a decent Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 and is classified as having enough capacity, which suggests it can handle a reasonable volume of data. Additionally, the market score of 0.5 indicates a moderate level of demand. However, the lack of data entropy and history reduces confidence in its comprehensive evaluation, suggesting some limitations in understanding its full potential. Therefore, the valuation reflects a balance between performance and uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a modest enhancement, which can be appealing in a competitive market. The medium data entropy and life suggest a reasonable level of reliability and usefulness for users. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, which could support a decent pricing strategy. However, the absence of historical data limits the confidence in the product's track record, slightly lowering the expected price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
