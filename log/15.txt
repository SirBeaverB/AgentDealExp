Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in competitive data-driven industries. However, the short data life and the lack of other traits such as capacity, data entropy, and market information suggest that the product may not have long-term viability or a robust market presence. This leads to a moderate price expectation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a decent level of enhancement, which can be valuable in a competitive market with a score of 0.4. However, the short data life and several NULL traits suggest limitations in scalability and long-term utility, which reduces overall confidence in the product's value.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:2050.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the value of the data product given its decent Model Performance Improvement of 0.2, which can enhance performance in a competitive market. While there are limitations due to the short data life and NULL traits, I believe the product still holds significant potential.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 2200. While the Model Performance Improvement of 0.2 is promising, the short data life and lack of additional traits suggest that this product may not provide long-term value. Therefore, I believe a price of 2200 more accurately reflects its potential while still being a fair starting point for our negotiations.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 2100. This price reflects the recognized value of the 0.2 Model Performance Improvement, while also considering the concerns about the short data life and NULL traits. It strikes a balance between the offers made, acknowledging the limited long-term value yet still presenting a compelling opportunity for immediate utility.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 2000. This price acknowledges the 0.2 Model Performance Improvement while recognizing the concerns regarding the short data life and NULL traits. It presents a fair compromise between the previous offers and strikes a balance that reflects both immediate utility and longer-term considerations.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 2050. This reflects the balance between immediate utility and the concerns regarding long-term value, acknowledging the 0.2 Model Performance Improvement while also considering the product's limitations. This price positions us favorably for a deal that recognizes both the short-term benefit and the longer-term uncertainties.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 2050. This price reflects a careful consideration of the product's immediate utility due to its 0.2 Model Performance Improvement, while still acknowledging the concerns regarding its limited long-term value and short data life. It positions us well to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
