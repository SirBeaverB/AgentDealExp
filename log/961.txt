Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle a decent volume of data. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data entropy, data life, history, and market limits the valuation. Given these factors, a moderate price reflects the potential utility without strong supporting traits.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which is a positive trait. A low data entropy suggests that the data is structured and predictable, making it easier to work with. Additionally, a long data life means that the data product can remain relevant for an extended period. However, the lack of historical data and the moderate market score indicates that while the product has some promising traits, there are limitations in terms of market demand and track record. Thus, the price reflects the potential while considering the uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
