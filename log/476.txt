Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance existing models but may not be a breakthrough solution. The market score of 0.5 suggests a decent demand, although the short data life and lack of historical data may limit its long-term value. Given the mixed traits, a price reflecting its potential but not overly optimistic is appropriate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which suggests it can enhance existing models to some extent. The capacity is described as "enough," indicating that it can handle the necessary data volume. However, the data entropy is low, implying the data is relatively clean and structured. The short data life could limit its long-term value. The market score of 0.5 suggests a moderate demand but not overwhelming. The lack of historical data raises some concerns about reliability and consistency. Overall, the product has potential but also significant limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
