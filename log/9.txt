Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable to users seeking efficiency. However, the absence of critical traits such as data entropy, data life, history, and market limits the overall assessment, suggesting that while there is potential value, it may not be fully realized due to the lack of supporting data.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates some value in enhancing performance. The market size is relatively small at 0.3, suggesting limited demand, but the low data entropy implies the data is relatively clean and reliable. However, the short data life raises concerns about long-term usability, which affects overall value. Given these factors, a price around 5000 seems reasonable.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
