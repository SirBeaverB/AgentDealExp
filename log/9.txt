Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can attract interest from users looking to improve their models. However, the short data life and the presence of multiple NULL traits suggest limited long-term value and potential uncertainties in capacity and data entrophy. The market size score of 0.4 indicates some level of demand, but overall, the product lacks comprehensive traits to command a higher price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in performance indicated by the Model Performance Improvement, which can attract users seeking to enhance their models. While the data has a short life and some uncertainties, I believe the demand can justify this initial price.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 900. Given the uncertainties and limited available traits and performance metrics, I believe this price reflects a cautious approach to the product's value. This offers a baseline that aligns with the minimal market confidence I perceive.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1500. This price reflects a balanced approach considering the moderate performance improvements and potential demand while factoring in the cautious sentiment from the lower offer. I believe this is a fair midpoint that acknowledges both perspectives.
