Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25 and a low data entropy, indicating a stable performance with predictable outcomes. However, the lack of data life and history raises concerns about long-term reliability and usage, which could deter potential buyers. The market score of 0.5 suggests a moderate demand, contributing to a reasonable valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.25 indicates a reasonable enhancement, which adds value. However, the low data entropy suggests that the data is relatively stable and may not yield high insights. The short data life implies that the product may become outdated quickly, which can affect long-term value. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand. Overall, the product has some valuable traits but also significant limitations, justifying a moderate price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the significant enhancement in model performance of 0.25, which adds considerable value to the data product despite its limitations such as low data entropy and short data life. I believe this is a fair starting point given the potential insights the data can provide.
