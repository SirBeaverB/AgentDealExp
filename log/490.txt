Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in many applications. Additionally, a market score of 0.3 suggests there is some demand for this type of data product. However, the lack of information on data entropy, data life, and history limits the overall confidence in the product's long-term value and reliability, resulting in a conservative estimate.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model shows a significant performance improvement (MPI of 0.25), which indicates that it can enhance existing processes or products. The low data entropy suggests high quality and reliability of the data, making it attractive for potential users. The medium data life implies that it can be used effectively for a decent duration, while the market rating of 0.3 indicates a reasonable level of demand. However, the lack of historical data (NULL) introduces some uncertainty, slightly lowering the overall confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
