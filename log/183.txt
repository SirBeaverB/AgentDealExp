{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The data product has enough capacity and a medium level of data entropy, which indicates it can provide useful insights within its limitations. However, the short data life suggests it may not be sustainable in the long run, which could affect its value. The lack of performance improvement and market data reduces confidence, but the existing traits still suggest a reasonable value for short-term use.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing to potential users. The capacity being "enough" suggests that it can handle the required data loads, and a medium data entropy implies that it has a reasonable level of variability. However, the short data life could limit its ongoing value. The market score of 0.5 indicates a moderate demand. Overall, these factors contribute to a mid-range value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
