Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a significant enhancement in performance, which is valuable for many businesses looking to optimize their data products. However, the lack of information on capacity, data entropy, and history limits the overall assessment. Despite these gaps, the medium data life suggests that the product has some longevity in the market.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing to potential users. However, the NULL values for capacity and data entropy indicate a lack of crucial information that could significantly impact the product's value. The medium data life suggests some longevity, while a market score of 0.4 indicates a reasonable demand. Overall, the expected price reflects a balance between moderate performance improvement and the uncertainty from the missing traits.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
