Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and high data entropy, suggesting it can handle complex data and provide valuable insights. However, the short data life limits long-term value, and the lack of information on model performance and market conditions creates uncertainty. Thus, the expected price reflects the potential value while considering the limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can attract buyers looking for improvements. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle current market demands. However, high data entropy and short data life can limit its long-term usefulness, which might lower its overall value. The market score of 0.5 indicates a moderate demand, suggesting that while there are interested parties, competition may affect pricing. Overall, the product has potential, but the short data life and high entropy may detract from its value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
