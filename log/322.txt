Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': "The product has a market rating of 0.5, indicating a moderate level of demand. However, with several traits marked as NULL, such as Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy, there is uncertainty regarding the product's efficacy and value proposition. Hence, the expected price is modest.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate improvement in model performance (MPI of 0.2) and has enough capacity, which can be appealing to certain sectors. However, the high data entropy and short data life suggest limited long-term utility, impacting overall value. The market demand being at 0.5 indicates an average level of interest; therefore, while there is some potential for value, it is tempered by the short lifespan and uncertainty in the history of the product.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
