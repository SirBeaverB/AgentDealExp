{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'high'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a notable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates a significant enhancement in performance. However, the high Data Entropy suggests complexity in the data, which could limit its usability without clear history or data life metrics. The market rate of 0.4 indicates potential demand, but the NULL traits reduce overall confidence in the product's long-term value. Therefore, the price reflects a balance between its potential and the uncertainty introduced by the missing data.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '8000', 'reason': 'The product shows a noticeable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates it can significantly enhance the performance of existing models. The capacity is deemed sufficient, and the data life is long, suggesting sustainability and relevance in the market. However, the high data entropy may imply complexity, which could affect usability or implementation. The market potential at 0.4 indicates a reasonable demand, though the NULL history trait means there is limited information on past performance. Overall, the combination of traits suggests a solid product, but the lack of historical data reduces confidence.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 10000. This price reflects the significant model performance improvement of 0.25 that our data product provides, indicating a robust capability to enhance existing models. The long data life and substantial market potential make it a valuable asset, despite some complexity due to high data entropy. I believe this investment will yield considerable returns for you.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1000. Given the notable improvements in model performance, the complexity introduced by high data entropy and the uncertainty regarding its long-term value makes it essential to start low. This price reflects my cautious approach to the inherent risks involved.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 8000. This price reflects a balance between the significant value I believe this data can provide and the concerns about long-term stability and data entropy. I recognize the buyer's points about model performance, but I also need to ensure the deal reflects the inherent risks involved.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 7900. I believe this price acknowledges the seller's concerns while still reflecting the substantial value that this data can bring to enhance model performance. It¡¯s a fair compromise that considers both the risks and the potential benefits.

Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 7600. I believe this price strikes a reasonable balance, acknowledging the data's potential while still addressing the inherent risks involved. It's a competitive offer that reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 5 (Seller): I offer 7650. This price reflects a balanced consideration of the data's value while acknowledging the risks associated with long-term performance and stability. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 5 (Buyer): I offer 7550. I believe this reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the data while also considering the inherent risks involved. Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 6 (Seller): I offer 7600. I believe this price reflects a fair value considering the ongoing balance between the data's potential and the inherent risks we¡¯ve discussed. It also aligns closely with the last offer from the buyer while still emphasizing the quality and performance improvements of the data.
Round 6 (Buyer): I offer 7500. Given the ongoing discussions and the seller's latest offer, I believe this price strikes a reasonable balance between the value of the data and the inherent risks associated with it. It acknowledges the seller's perspective while still reflecting my commitment to securing a fair deal.
Round 7 (Seller): I offer 7550. This reflects a balanced consideration of the data's potential value and the associated risks we've discussed in previous rounds. I'm looking for a fair compromise that acknowledges both parties' perspectives.
Round 7 (Buyer): I offer 7450. I believe this price reflects a fair assessment of the data's potential value while also considering the risks we've discussed. I'm aiming for a balanced compromise that acknowledges both our perspectives and helps us move closer to a deal.
Round 8 (Seller): I offer 7500. This price reflects a balanced consideration of the data's value while acknowledging the inherent risks. It's a fair compromise that allows us to move closer to an agreement.
Round 8 (Buyer): I offer 7400. This price reflects my continued recognition of the data's potential while also considering the associated risks. I believe this offer serves as a reasonable step towards a mutual agreement, allowing us both to feel confident in the deal.
Round 9 (Seller): I offer 7450. I believe this price reflects a fair assessment of the data's value while considering the inherent risks we've discussed. It's crucial to find a balance that acknowledges both potential performance improvements and the uncertainties involved.
Round 9 (Buyer): I offer 7400. I believe this price continues to reflect a reasonable balance between the data's value and the risks involved, while also showing my willingness to reach an agreement. Let's find a mutual understanding that respects both our positions.
