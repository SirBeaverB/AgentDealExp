Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable for businesses looking to improve their analytics. However, the short data life and the absence of other key traits such as Data Entropy, History, and Market information limit the overall assessment. Given these factors, the pricing reflects a balanced consideration of potential value against the uncertainty introduced by the NULL traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The product shows a reasonable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it has the potential to enhance performance. However, the medium data entropy and short data life suggest it may not be long-lasting or highly reliable in the long term. The market score of 0.4 suggests moderate demand, which could limit the price. Overall, while the product has potential, its short data life and medium entropy make it less attractive, leading to a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 3000. This price reflects the considerable potential of the data product, given its reasonable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which can enhance performance significantly. While there are some concerns regarding its medium data entropy and short data life, I believe the current demand warrants a higher starting price.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1200. Given the short data life and lack of other key traits such as Data Entropy and History, I believe a significant discount is warranted. The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 does provide some value, but it does not justify the high starting price of 3000.
