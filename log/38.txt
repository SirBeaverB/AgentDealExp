Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates some potential for enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in specific applications. However, the market score of 0.4 suggests a moderate demand. The lack of additional traits limits the confidence in a higher valuation, but the existing traits still provide a foundation for some value.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it can enhance model performance to a certain extent. However, the lack of capacity, data entropy, and historical data diminishes the comprehensiveness of the evaluation. Despite these gaps, the market rating of 0.4 suggests there is demand for such a product, allowing for a reasonable valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
