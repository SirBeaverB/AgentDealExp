Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The market score of 0.4 indicates a presence in the market, albeit with low demand or competitiveness. However, the lack of quantitative traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, and History significantly limits the product's attractiveness and perceived value. Hence, the price reflects a cautious estimate based on the minimal market presence.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing in certain markets. The market score of 0.4 also suggests a reasonable demand for the product, despite the lack of additional traits like capacity and data entropy. The medium data life adds some value, but the overall uncertainty due to multiple NULL traits limits confidence.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
