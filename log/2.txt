Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('small', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': ([4300, 3100, 8200, 2200, 9500, 7500, 900, 6300, 3300, 800], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '$500', 'reason': "The available market value of 0.3 indicates a low demand or limited applicability for the data product. Additionally, the absence of critical traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, and History significantly limits the understanding of the product's potential. Given the lack of detailed information, the price is set at a minimal level to reflect the uncertainty and low market interest.", 'confidence': 'Low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '$2,500', 'reason': 'The product has a modest Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating some effectiveness but not a strong enhancement compared to existing solutions. The small capacity and low data entropy suggest it may not handle large-scale operations effectively, limiting its market appeal. Additionally, the short data life implies that the product may not remain useful for long, further dampening its value. The market rating of 0.3 indicates limited demand, reinforcing a lower expected price.', 'confidence': 'Medium'}
Deal Price:215.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 200. The available market value of 0.3 indicates a low demand or limited applicability for the data product, and the absence of critical traits such as Model Performance Improvement and Data History significantly diminishes its potential value.
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 250. Given the modest Model Performance Improvement and limited market appeal, this price reflects the potential value while leaving room for negotiation.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 210. The analysts have highlighted the low market value and limited demand for the data product, which restricts its appeal and potential. I believe a price slightly above the initial offer reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the concerns raised.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 220. While I acknowledge the concerns regarding market value and demand, I believe this price strikes a balance between the analysts' insights and the inherent value of the data product. It reflects a reasonable increment that recognizes the potential benefits while still being competitive in the current landscape.
