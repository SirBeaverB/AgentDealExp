Buying Valuer:
{'price': '200', 'reason': 'The product has only one trait with a quantifiable value (Market', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.2 suggests a slight enhancement, but the small capacity and low data entropy indicate limited scalability and potential application. Additionally, a short data life implies the product may not have lasting relevance. Given the history data shows variability, it reflects some demand but not consistent high performance. The market factor of 0.3 suggests medium potential, but overall, the product's limitations keep the expected price moderate.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
