{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('small', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': ([8800, 5100, 1600, 1700, 1500], [8800, 5100, 1600, 1700, 1500]), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The history data indicates past performance with a decreasing trend, starting from a high of 8800 down to 1500. This suggests that the product has had some value in the past but may be facing challenges. However, the lack of key information (like MPI, Capacity, Data Entropy, and Data Life) limits the ability to accurately assess current value. Given these factors, a mid-range price is suggested.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.2 suggests a moderate enhancement in efficacy, but the small capacity and low data entropy indicate limited scalability and complexity. Additionally, the short data life implies that the product may not have long-term utility, reducing its overall value. The market score of 0.3 indicates low demand, which further constrains potential pricing. The historical values show variability, but the most recent values suggest a downward trend, reinforcing a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
