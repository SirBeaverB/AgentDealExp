Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The market score of 0.3 indicates a low demand or interest in the data product. However, since there are no traits available to provide further context on its performance or capacity, the valuation remains speculative. A price of 2000 is suggested as a baseline for a product with limited information and market potential.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model efficiency, which could be appealing in competitive industries. However, the short data life and the presence of NULL values in capacity, data entropy, and history suggest limited long-term value and potential uncertainty in the product's reliability. The market score of 0.3 indicates a low to moderate demand in its current state. This combination leads to a conservative valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1742.5
