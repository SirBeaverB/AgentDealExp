Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model effectiveness, which can be appealing in the data-driven market. However, the NULL traits suggest significant gaps in information regarding capacity, data entropy, and data life, which limits the overall understanding of the product's value. The market score of 0.5 indicates a potential demand but not strong enough to command a higher price. Hence, the expected price reflects a balance of moderate performance and the uncertainty due to missing data.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement, which can be appealing in certain markets. The long data life suggests potential for sustained value over time. However, the NULL traits regarding capacity, data entropy, and history make it difficult to assess the full potential and risk of the product. The market value of 0.5 indicates there's some demand, but given the uncertainty from the NULL traits, the valuation is conservative.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1600.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in model performance and the potential for sustained value due to the long data life. While there are some uncertainties regarding the NULL traits, I believe the demand in the market warrants this higher valuation.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400. This price reflects my assessment of the moderate enhancement in model performance while considering the uncertainties from the NULL traits. Given the market score, I believe this price aligns with the current demand dynamics.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. I believe this price reflects the moderate enhancements in model performance and accounts for the existing uncertainties in the market. It balances the offers made previously while still recognizing the sustained value of the data product.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1600. This price reflects a fair compromise between the previous offers, acknowledging the moderate enhancements in model performance while also considering the uncertainties in the market. It positions us closer to a potential agreement while still valuing the data product appropriately.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1650. This price reflects a balanced consideration of the moderate enhancements in model performance and the existing market uncertainties. It represents a fair compromise while still recognizing the inherent value of the data product.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1550. This price takes into account the moderate enhancements in model performance while also addressing the prevailing market uncertainties. It represents a reasonable and strategic step towards reaching an agreement, balancing value and risk effectively.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1600. This price reflects the moderate enhancements in model performance while also considering the ongoing market uncertainties. It presents a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the data product.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 1600. This price reflects my assessment of the current moderate enhancements in model performance while also considering the ongoing market uncertainties. It represents a balanced approach that acknowledges the intrinsic value of the data product and aims for a fair resolution in our negotiations.
