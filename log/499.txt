Buying Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': 'The product has medium data life and sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle ongoing usage and support current market demands. However, the presence of multiple NULL traits limits the ability to assess its full potential and market positioning, leading to a conservative valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance existing models to some extent. The low data entropy suggests that the data is relatively clean and reliable, which is favorable. Additionally, the medium data life indicates that the data will remain relevant for a while, enhancing its value. Even though the market rating is only 0.4, it still suggests there is some demand. Overall, these traits point towards a product that can be valuable in the right context, hence the price of 5000.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
