Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and low data entropy, which indicates that it can provide reliable and consistent data insights. However, the short data life and lack of model performance improvement suggest limited long-term value. The market value of 0.4 reflects moderate demand, indicating a potential price that aligns with other similar products.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating some value in improving performance. However, the data life is short, which may limit its long-term use. The low data entropy suggests consistency in the data, but the lack of historical data and a market score of 0.4 indicates uncertainty in demand. Overall, there is value, but it's constrained by several factors.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
