Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a high data entropy, which suggests it contains a rich variety of information that could be valuable for various applications. However, the market score of 0.3 indicates that demand might be limited. The lack of information on model performance improvement and data life reduces confidence, but the capacity being "enough" implies it can handle current needs.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.25 suggests a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive in certain markets. However, the high data entropy indicates that the data is complex and possibly difficult to interpret or utilize effectively. The short data life limits the long-term value of the product. Despite these challenges, the market demand rating of 0.3 indicates some level of interest, allowing for a reasonable price expectation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
