Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in data-driven industries. The market score of 0.3 suggests there is some demand, but the presence of NULL traits (Data Entropy, Data Life, History) raises concerns about the completeness of the data product. Given these uncertainties, a conservative price is justified.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can attract buyers looking for efficiency improvements. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle a reasonable amount of data, making it usable for various applications. However, the medium data entropy and short data life may limit its long-term value, and the market size of 0.3 suggests a niche demand. Overall, despite some limitations, the product holds potential value in a specific market.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
