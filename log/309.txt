Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a sufficient capacity and high data entropy, which can be valuable in applications requiring diverse and complex data. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data life, history, and market limits the overall assessment, suggesting a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating it may provide some value in improving existing models. However, the data entropy is high, suggesting that the data may be unpredictable or complex, which could limit its usability. The short data life indicates that the product may not have long-term applicability, which can also negatively impact its value. The market score of 0.4 suggests there is some demand but not overwhelming. Overall, these factors lead to a moderate price estimate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
