Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate improvement, which can be valuable in certain applications. The market score of 0.4 suggests that there is a reasonable demand for this product. However, the lack of data on capacity, entropy, life, and history limits the overall assessment, making it difficult to gauge the product's long-term value and sustainability.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can attract potential buyers. However, the short data life and several NULL traits limit the value. The market score of 0.4 suggests there is some demand, but the lack of concrete data regarding capacity and data entropy diminishes overall confidence in the product's long-term viability.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
