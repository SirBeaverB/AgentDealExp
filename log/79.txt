Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate improvement in model performance, which can be valuable for users looking to enhance their systems. However, the lack of information regarding capacity, data entropy, and history suggests limited versatility and reliability, which may affect its marketability. Given the short data life, the product may only have short-term value, but the performance improvement could still justify a reasonable price.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement over existing models, which could appeal to businesses looking to improve their data-driven decisions. However, the short data life and multiple NULL traits limit the overall potential and applicability of the product in the market, thus justifying a relatively conservative price.', 'confidence': 'low'}
