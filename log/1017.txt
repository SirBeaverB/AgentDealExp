Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be appealing to potential users.

Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which could be attractive to potential users. The market score of 0.3 suggests a niche or limited demand, while the medium data entropy indicates that the data is of reasonable quality. However, the short data life and lack of historical data could limit its long-term value and usability. Despite these drawbacks, the product still holds some potential in specific applications.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
