Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': 'The product has a low market value of 0.3 and several traits are NULL, indicating a lack of available data to support a higher valuation. This suggests limited potential and demand for the product.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it can enhance existing models significantly. However, the short data life and lack of additional traits (like capacity and data entropy) suggest limited long-term value. The market score of 0.3 shows modest demand, and the null traits imply uncertainty. Therefore, the valuation reflects its potential while considering its limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:7000.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 7000. This price reflects the significant potential of the data product, given its Model Performance Improvement of 0.3, which can greatly enhance existing models. While there are limitations with its short data life and modest market demand, the value it brings is considerable, and I believe it warrants this higher initial offer.
