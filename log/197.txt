Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a positive but moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in certain markets. However, the absence of data on capacity, data entropy, data life, history, and market limits the overall assessment of the product's potential value. Given this uncertainty, a conservative price is suggested.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a reasonable enhancement in model effectiveness, which can be attractive in data-driven industries. Although there are several NULL traits, the long data life suggests that the product has lasting relevance, and the market score of 0.3 implies some level of demand. However, the uncertainty due to NULL values limits the potential price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
