Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle a reasonable amount of data processing. However, the short data life indicates that the product may not be suitable for long-term use, thereby limiting its value. The market score of 0.4 suggests a moderate demand, which can also impact the price. Overall, the combination of these traits leads to a cautious estimate.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement potential, which can attract interest in a competitive market. The capacity is adequate, and while the data entropy is medium, it suggests some complexity that could provide value. However, the short data life and the absence of historical data limit long-term utility, which may affect buyer willingness to pay a premium. The market score of 0.4 indicates a moderate demand, leading to a balanced valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
