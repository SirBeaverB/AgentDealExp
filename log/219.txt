Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a modest Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance. However, the NULL traits regarding Data Entropy and Market suggest a lack of critical information about the product's overall utility and market positioning. Given the medium Data Life, the product has some value, but the uncertainties limit its potential price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '8000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a significant enhancement, which is attractive in the market. The "enough" capacity and medium data entropy and life suggest that the product is reliable and adaptable to various use cases. However, the market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, which tempers the pricing expectation. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a solid valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
