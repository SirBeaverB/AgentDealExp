Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has a sufficient capacity and a market score of 0.3, indicating some demand. However, the lack of information on key traits such as Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy suggests that potential buyers might have uncertainties regarding its effectiveness and reliability. This limits the valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to potential users. However, the short data life and medium data entropy suggest that the product may not be suitable for long-term use or high-stakes applications. The market score of 0.3 indicates limited demand, but there is still some value in the product due to its performance improvement. Overall, the product has potential but is constrained, resulting in a moderate expected price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
