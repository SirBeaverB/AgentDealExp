Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life and sufficient capacity, which suggests it can still be useful in the market. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data entropy, and history limits confidence in its overall effectiveness. The market rating of 0.5 indicates a moderate demand, so the price reflects a cautious valuation considering these factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': "The product has a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates a noticeable improvement in performance. The capacity is sufficient, and while data entropy is high, suggesting complexity, the medium data life implies potential longevity in usefulness. The market rating of 0.5 indicates moderate demand. However, the NULL history trait limits the confidence in the product's past effectiveness and reliability. Therefore, the price reflects a balance of potential and uncertainty.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:No deal.
