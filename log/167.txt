{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and medium data entropy, which suggests it can handle a reasonable amount of data with a decent level of complexity. However, the short data life indicates that the product may not provide long-term value, and the lack of information on model performance improvement and market data limits its attractiveness. This leads to a moderate price expectation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a modest enhancement in performance, but the short data life and medium entropy suggest that the product may not provide long-term value. However, with adequate capacity and a market score of 0.4, there is potential for demand, albeit limited. The lack of historical data (NULL) affects the overall confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
