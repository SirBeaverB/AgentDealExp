{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and a medium data life, which suggests it can support a reasonable level of usage and retain relevance for a while. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data entropy, history, and market significantly limits the overall confidence in the valuation. Given the uncertainty, a conservative price point is advisable.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance performance effectively. Although the data entropy is high, suggesting complexity, the capacity is sufficient for potential use. The medium data life implies it has a reasonable lifespan for practical application. The market value of 0.4 indicates there is some demand, but the lack of historical data may limit confidence in long-term adoption. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
