Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product lacks critical data traits which impedes a thorough valuation, yet there is potential demand for data products in the market. A baseline price reflects a speculative value due to uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a decent enhancement in model effectiveness, which can be valuable in a competitive market. However, the NULL values for capacity and data entropy limit the potential insights into scalability and reliability. The medium data life suggests a reasonable longevity but may require periodic updates. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, which supports a modest pricing strategy.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
