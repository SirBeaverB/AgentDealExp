Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity, which suggests it can handle a reasonable amount of data processing, but the high data entropy indicates complexity and potential value in the insights generated. However, the short data life could limit its long-term usability, and the lack of information on model performance improvement, history, and market makes the valuation uncertain.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The data product shows a positive Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance performance, which is attractive to potential buyers. The capacity is deemed ¡°enough,¡± suggesting it can handle demand, but the high data entropy indicates variability or unpredictability in the data. However, the short data life limits its long-term value. Given the market score of 0.4, there is some demand, but the overall uncertainty due to high entropy and short data life affects its valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
