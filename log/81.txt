Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The absence of specific traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market indicates a significant lack of information regarding the product's effectiveness and potential. However, there may still be a baseline value due to potential applications or existing demand in uncertain markets.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing in the market. However, the short data life and many NULL traits suggest limited longevity and detailed insights about the product's capabilities. The market score of 0.4 hints at a modest demand. Considering these factors, the product may attract a niche audience, justifying a price around 5000.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
