Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The product demonstrates a significant model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25 and has a long data life, indicating it can provide valuable insights over time. However, the lack of information regarding data entropy and history, as well as market conditions, limits the valuation. Given the strengths and weaknesses, a mid-range price is justified.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates it can provide tangible benefits in performance. Additionally, the capacity is sufficient, and the data life is long, suggesting sustainability and usability over time. However, the high data entropy can imply complexity in usage, which may deter some users. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, which affects the overall valuation. The lack of historical data is a drawback, but the existing positive traits allow for a reasonable price estimation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
