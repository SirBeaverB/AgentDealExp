Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be beneficial for businesses looking to optimize their data-driven decisions. However, the absence of other critical traits such as capacity, data entropy, data life, history, and market makes it difficult to gauge the overall value and applicability of the product. Despite this, the MPI provides a basis for valuation given its potential impact.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25 suggests a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. The long data life indicates that the product could provide sustained value over time. However, the NULL values for capacity and data entropy limit the overall assessment of the product's potential, leading to some uncertainty. The market score of 0.5 indicates a moderate level of demand, which supports a reasonable price point.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
