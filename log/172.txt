Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life, which indicates it can provide value for a moderate duration. However, the market score of 0.3 suggests limited demand, and the absence of key traits (such as Model Performance Improvement and Capacity) reduces confidence in its overall effectiveness. Thus, the expected price reflects a balance between its potential utility and the uncertainty surrounding its performance.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing in certain markets. However, the lack of data on capacity, data entropy, and history limits the overall assessment of its potential value. Given the medium data life, it indicates some relevance, but the market score of 0.3 reflects limited demand. Overall, the product shows potential but has significant limitations due to missing traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
