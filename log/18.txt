Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The market value is indicated at 0.5, suggesting a moderate demand. However, the absence of key performance metrics and other traits significantly limits the product's appeal and usability. Therefore, a conservative estimate is warranted.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 suggests that the product has some effectiveness in enhancing performance, which adds value. However, the short data life and lack of information on capacity and data entropy limit its long-term usability and robustness. The market value of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, which can support a reasonable price. Given these factors, the expected price reflects the potential value, but caution is advised due to the gaps in information.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
