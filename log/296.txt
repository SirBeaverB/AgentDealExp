Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'high'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity, indicating it can handle the required data volume. However, the high data entropy suggests that the data may be complex and potentially difficult to analyze. The short data life indicates that the usefulness of the data may diminish quickly, which could lower its overall value. The market value of 0.3 suggests limited demand or competition. Therefore, while the product has some positive traits, the negatives mitigate its overall value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a modest enhancement in model performance, which may attract some buyers. However, the high data entropy suggests that the data is complex and potentially difficult to interpret or utilize effectively. The short data life limits the product's usability, while the lack of historical performance data raises concerns about reliability. The market score of 0.3 indicates a relatively low demand, further impacting potential pricing. Overall, these factors lead to a conservative valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
