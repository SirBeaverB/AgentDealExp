Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which suggests it can enhance performance significantly. However, the high data entropy indicates variability and complexity, which may require more sophisticated handling. The medium data life suggests that it has a reasonable timeframe for use but isn't evergreen. The lack of historical and market data limits confidence, but the existing traits still imply some value, especially for specific industries looking for performance improvements.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing in a competitive market. The capacity is deemed "enough," suggesting the product can handle a reasonable amount of data or workload. However, the high data entropy might indicate complexity, which could deter some users. The medium data life suggests that the product still has some relevance but may need updates or replacements in the near future. The market potential of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, which supports a reasonable pricing strategy. The absence of historical data ("NULL") does create uncertainty, but the other traits provide a basis for a value estimation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in performance indicated by the Model Performance Improvement, as well as the product's capacity and market potential. Given the complexity suggested by the high data entropy and the medium data life, this price positions the product competitively in the market while accounting for its unique traits.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. The product does show potential for performance improvement, but the high data entropy and medium data life suggest some inherent risks and limitations. My offer reflects a balanced approach considering these factors while still recognizing the product's value in specific industries.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. This price reflects the high quality and competitive positioning of the product while also considering the buyer's concerns about data entropy and life. I believe this is a fair compromise that highlights the value of the data being offered.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price strikes a balance between acknowledging the seller's emphasis on quality and competitive positioning while still addressing my concerns regarding data entropy and life. This offer reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1680. This price reflects the exceptional quality and potential of the data product while also considering the buyer's previous offer of 1650. I'm confident this is a fair middle ground that acknowledges the product's value without straying too far from the buyer's budget.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1670. I believe this price reflects a reasonable middle ground, acknowledging the seller's quality claims while still considering my previous offers and concerns about the product's data entropy and lifespan.
