Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a significant enhancement in effectiveness, which is valuable in data products. However, the lack of other traits such as data entropy, data life, history, and market information limits the overall assessment, making it harder to pinpoint the product's full potential. The expected price reflects a balance between its performance improvement and the uncertainty due to missing information.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which is attractive for potential users looking for efficiency gains. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle existing workloads, but the high data entropy implies complexity and potential challenges in data management. The medium data life indicates that the product has a reasonable lifespan but may need updates or adjustments over time. The market score of 0.3 suggests a niche demand, which limits the potential customer base. Overall, while there are some positive aspects, the presence of high data entropy and a low market score limits the product\'s overall valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 3000. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in performance indicated by the Model Performance Improvement of 0.3, which is a compelling selling point for potential users seeking efficiency gains. Additionally, while the data product has some complexities due to high data entropy, its capacity being "enough" suggests it can effectively manage existing workloads. Given these factors, I believe this price is justified.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 2500. While the Model Performance Improvement of 0.3 is noteworthy, the uncertainties surrounding data entropy and other missing traits lead me to propose a more cautious price. I believe this reflects a fair compromise considering the inherent risks.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 2700.0. This price reflects a balanced consideration of the model performance improvements and the inherent data complexity risks. I believe it provides a fair value for the data product while still addressing concerns about uncertainties.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 2600. This price reflects my acknowledgment of the seller's considerations regarding model performance improvements and data complexity risks, while still allowing for a reasonable margin that aligns with my initial valuation. I believe this is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the data product while maintaining a cautious approach to the associated uncertainties.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 2650. I believe this price reflects a balanced consideration of the data product's performance improvements while also accounting for the inherent risks due to data complexity. This represents a fair compromise that acknowledges the buyer's concerns and my need for a reasonable margin.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 2600. I believe this price aligns with my assessment of the data product¡¯s performance improvements while also reflecting a cautious approach to the risks associated with data complexity. This offer acknowledges the seller's need for a reasonable margin while still keeping the buyer's perspective in mind.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 2620. I believe this price strikes a fair balance between acknowledging the buyer's concerns about performance improvements and the complexities associated with data. It's a cautious yet reasonable approach, aligning with our previous discussions while moving slightly higher to facilitate a potential agreement.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 2610. I believe this price reflects a slight increase while still remaining within a reasonable range compared to the seller's offer, acknowledging the importance of performance improvements and the complexities involved. This approach demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
