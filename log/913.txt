Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'Despite the absence of specific metrics such as Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy, the product has sufficient capacity which suggests it can handle the necessary volume of data. This indicates potential usability in applications. However, the lack of detailed traits limits the confidence in its performance and market fit, leading to a moderate price estimation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model shows a moderate performance improvement (MPI of 0.3), which indicates some potential for enhancing outcomes, albeit not exceptional. The capacity is sufficient, and low data entropy suggests that the data is well-structured and reliable. However, the medium data life and lack of historical data may limit long-term applicability and market trust. Given these factors, the product holds moderate value in a competitive market.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
