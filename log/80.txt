Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating that it has some value in enhancing performance. However, the short data life and several NULL traits limit its applicability and longevity in the market. The market potential of 0.3 suggests that there is some demand, but the lack of additional traits diminishes confidence in a higher valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates it can enhance performance but lacks comprehensive traits. The market size is also relatively low at 0.3, suggesting limited demand. Despite the short data life and the absence of several critical traits, the MPI suggests some value, albeit not very high.', 'confidence': 'low'}
