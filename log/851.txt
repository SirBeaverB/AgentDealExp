Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and enough capacity, which suggests it can be useful over time and handle a decent volume of data. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, History, and Market limits the confidence in its overall value. Despite these gaps, the long data life and adequate capacity indicate a foundational value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates that it has the potential to enhance existing models and offers substantial value to users. The capacity being "enough" suggests that it can handle the required workload. High data entropy can lead to diverse insights, and a long data life indicates longevity and relevance in the market. Despite the market score being only 0.5 and the absence of historical data, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, leading to a reasonable valuation.', 'confidence': 'high'}
