Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows sufficient capacity and medium data entropy, which suggests it has a decent level of complexity and value in terms of data analysis. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data life, history, and market diminishes its overall value. Therefore, the price reflects a baseline valuation given the positive traits despite the missing information.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance, which can attract interest from buyers seeking to improve their existing systems. The medium data entropy and medium data life suggest that the data is of moderate quality and relevance. Additionally, the market value of 0.3 indicates there is some demand for this type of product. However, the lack of historical data slightly diminishes the confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
