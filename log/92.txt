Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has a short data life and a moderate market demand (0.5), which suggests it may not have lasting value. However, there is still some market interest, indicating a price that reflects the potential utility of the product in a limited timeframe.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable to certain sectors. However, with a short data life and significant NULL traits (like capacity, data entropy, and history), the product's longevity and overall reliability are uncertain. The market score of 0.5 suggests some interest but does not guarantee high demand. Overall, while there is potential value, the uncertainties weigh down the price estimation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1750.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the potential value of the data product due to its moderate enhancement in performance, despite the uncertainties related to its longevity and reliability. I believe this initial offer sets a strong foundation for our negotiation.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1700. This price reflects my assessment of the data product's limited lifespan and moderate market demand, which suggests a lower value. I believe starting with a more conservative offer will allow us to find common ground as we negotiate further.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1750. The product has shown moderate performance enhancement, and while there are uncertainties, its value is still significant in the market. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1750. The product has demonstrated moderate performance enhancement, and I believe this price reflects its value while also considering the existing uncertainties. I'm optimistic that we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.
