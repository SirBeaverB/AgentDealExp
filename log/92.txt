{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which adds value to the product. The capacity being "enough" suggests it can meet demand without issues, while a medium data life implies it can remain relevant for a reasonable period. However, the market score of 0.5 indicates a moderate demand, and the presence of NULL traits suggests some uncertainty in the overall evaluation. Therefore, the expected price reflects potential value with caution.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a significant enhancement in performance, which is valuable in the market. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle the required data load, while low data entropy means the data is structured and reliable. Although the data life is medium and the market score is average at 0.5, these factors combined suggest a reasonable demand. However, the lack of historical data limits confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
