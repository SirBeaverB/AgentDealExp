Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a significant enhancement in model performance, which can be very valuable in data-driven applications. However, the lack of information on capacity, data entropy, data life, and history makes it difficult to assess the overall value comprehensively. Despite this, a reasonable base price can be set based on the improvement indicated.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable for businesses seeking to optimize their data-driven decisions. The market score of 0.5 suggests there is some demand for this type of product. However, the lack of information on capacity, data entropy, and a history of the product limits the confidence in the valuation. Given the medium data life, the product may still hold value in the short term.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
