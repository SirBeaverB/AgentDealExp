Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and low data entropy, which indicates it is reliable and likely to provide consistent results. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data life, history, and market makes it difficult to assess its full potential and value comprehensively. Given these factors, a moderate estimated price is justified.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates that the product has a measurable enhancement in performance, which can attract buyers looking for efficiency. The low data entropy suggests that the data is stable and reliable, adding to its value. Additionally, the long data life means it can be utilized over an extended period, which is attractive for businesses. However, the market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, which tempers the potential high value. Overall, the product has desirable traits, but the lack of historical data limits the confidence in its valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
