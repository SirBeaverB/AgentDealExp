Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and low data entropy, indicating it is reliable and stable over time. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement and history limits its attractiveness. The market demand is moderate, which also influences the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product demonstrates a notable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating it can enhance existing systems or processes. The low data entropy suggests that the data is coherent and reliable for analysis, while the long data life signifies sustainability and relevance over time. However, the market demand is relatively low at 0.3, which could limit the potential customer base. The absence of historical data could also introduce uncertainty in assessing its effectiveness in real-world applications. Therefore, while there are several positive traits, market conditions and missing historical context temper the overall valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
