Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity to meet demand, but the short data life may limit its long-term value. The market score of 0.4 suggests moderate interest, indicating potential for use but not widespread adoption. Given the uncertainties with several NULL traits, the valuation reflects a cautious approach.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates a strong potential for enhancing performance, making it attractive to buyers seeking efficiency. However, the high data entropy suggests complexities in data interpretation, and the short data life limits its long-term utility. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, which, combined with the aforementioned traits, supports a reasonable price point despite some limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
