Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and high data entropy, indicating potential for valuable insights. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data life, and market limits the valuation, leading to a moderate price estimate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '8000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it can enhance performance effectively, which is a strong selling point. The capacity is described as "enough," suggesting it can handle current demands. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, and while the data entropy is high, indicating potential complexity, the medium data life suggests it will remain relevant for a reasonable duration. However, the lack of historical data adds some uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
