Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it can enhance existing models to some extent. However, the short data life reduces its long-term applicability. The medium data entropy suggests a decent level of variability in the data. The lack of historical context and market information introduces uncertainty, but the product's potential utility still maintains some value.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate improvement in model performance (MPI of 0.2) which can be attractive for users looking to enhance their models. However, the short data life and medium data entropy may limit its long-term utility and appeal. The market demand is relatively low (0.3), which will also affect the pricing. Overall, these factors suggest a modest valuation in a competitive market.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
