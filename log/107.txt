Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life, suggesting it has some relevance and utility, but the absence of key traits such as model performance improvement, capacity, and market information limits the overall confidence in its potential. Given these factors, a moderate price is reasonable.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a decent enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to potential buyers. However, the lack of data on capacity, data entropy, and a complete history limits the robustness of the valuation. Nonetheless, given the medium data life and a market score of 0.4, it suggests some level of demand exists, justifying a moderate price point.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Round 1 (Seller): I offer 7000. This price reflects the significant enhancement in performance indicated by the model performance improvement of 0.25, showcasing the value and potential impact of this data product in driving results for your needs.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 4000. This price aligns with the medium data life and the limited attributes of the product, which don't fully justify a higher investment at this stage.
