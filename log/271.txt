Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product demonstrates a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it has the potential to enhance existing models effectively. Additionally, the long data life suggests it could be useful over an extended period, and the medium data entropy implies a reasonable level of complexity and variability in the data. However, the lack of market information and history does introduce uncertainty, limiting the confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it can enhance existing systems but may not be groundbreaking. The capacity is adequate, and the data life is long, suggesting sustainability and utility over time. However, the medium data entropy implies some complexity in data handling. The market score of 0.4 indicates a potential but not overwhelming demand, which balances the overall valuation. The absence of historical data is a drawback, yet the positive traits warrant a reasonable price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
