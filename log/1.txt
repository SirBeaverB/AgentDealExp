Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The absence of specific traits makes it difficult to ascertain the true value of the data product. However, I assume there is some base value due to potential applications in data-driven industries. The expected price reflects a cautious estimate considering the uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement, but the capacity is small, and the data entropy is low, which limits its applicability in more complex scenarios. Additionally, a short data life suggests that the product may not be suitable for long-term use. The market value of 0.3 indicates a low demand, further impacting the expected price. Historical values show a declining trend, which also suggests that the product may not retain high value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
