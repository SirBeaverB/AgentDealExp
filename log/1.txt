Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': "The absence of key traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, and others indicates a lack of information about the product's capabilities and market potential. This uncertainty leads to a low valuation, as potential buyers would be hesitant to invest without concrete data to support the product's effectiveness and value.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates that the product has some potential for enhancing performance, but the short data life and lack of available capacity and data entropy information suggest limitations. The market size of 0.3 indicates moderate demand, which supports a reasonable valuation despite the uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'low'}
