{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('small', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': ([4100, 10000, 8100, 1200, 1300, 7600, 2800, 1900, 3500, 9500], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '100', 'reason': "The absence of critical traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market makes it difficult to assess the product's value. Without this information, it is likely to be considered a low-value or experimental product.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) is moderate at 0.2, which suggests some potential for improvement in outcomes, but this is countered by the low market score of 0.3 indicating limited demand. The capacity is small, and the data life is short, suggesting that the product may not be sustainable or widely applicable. The history data shows variability in usage but does not indicate a strong trend. Overall, these factors suggest a low to moderate value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:750.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 800. This price reflects the moderate potential for improvement indicated by the Model Performance Improvement, while also considering the low market score and limited demand for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation given the factors at play.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 700. This price takes into account the lack of critical traits and overall low value of the product, which makes it more of an experimental offering rather than a robust data solution. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 750. Given the feedback regarding the product's moderate improvement potential and its current low market demand, I believe this price reflects a fair value while also addressing the concerns raised by the analysts.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 750. I believe this price accurately reflects the product's moderate improvement potential while still addressing the concerns about low market demand and overall value. It represents a fair compromise based on the analysts' feedback.
