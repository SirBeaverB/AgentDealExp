{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity, which indicates it can handle a significant volume of data, making it potentially valuable in the market. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market limits the overall confidence in its valuation. Therefore, while it has some value, it is likely at the lower end of the spectrum due to the missing traits.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product shows a reasonable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating that it can enhance performance to some extent. The capacity is sufficient, which is a positive aspect for potential users. However, the low data entropy suggests that the data may not be very diverse, and the short data life could limit its usefulness for long-term projects. The market score of 0.3 indicates moderate demand, but the NULL history trait raises concerns about the product's proven track record. Overall, these factors lead to a cautious valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 6000. This price reflects the substantial potential of the data product, particularly its reasonable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 and sufficient capacity, which can enhance performance in various applications. Although there are concerns about low data entropy and short data life, the value provided justifies a higher starting price.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 4800. While I acknowledge the potential value of the data product and its capacity, the concerns regarding low data entropy and short data life significantly affect my valuation. I believe 4800 is a more reasonable starting point considering these factors.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 5500. The product has significant potential and can enhance performance, making it a valuable investment despite concerns about data entropy and lifespan. This price reflects both the quality and the unique benefits it brings.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 5400. The product does have potential, but I still have concerns about data entropy and lifespan, which affect my valuation. This price reflects my willingness to meet closer to the seller's offer while still considering the risks associated with the product.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 5500. This price reflects my confidence in the data product¡¯s potential while considering the concerns raised about data entropy and lifespan. I believe this is a fair compromise, balancing both our positions.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 5400. I believe this price fairly acknowledges the seller's confidence in the data product while still taking into account the concerns regarding data entropy and lifespan. It's a reasonable middle ground that reflects both parties' positions.
