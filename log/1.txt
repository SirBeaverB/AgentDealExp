Buying Valuer:
{'price': '$5,000', 'reason': "The lack of available traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market indicates that there is insufficient information to accurately assess the product's value. However, given that data products can still hold some intrinsic value based on potential applications or market interest, a nominal price reflecting minimal confidence is appropriate.", 'confidence': 'Low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '$5,000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.4 indicates a moderate enhancement, which could be beneficial for small-scale applications. However, the small market size, low data entropy, short data life, and short history suggest limited demand and potential for longevity in the market, which constrains the value.', 'confidence': '65%'}
