Buying Valuer:
{'price': '$5,000', 'reason': 'The absence of critical traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market makes it difficult to fully assess the value of the product. However, a base price reflects the potential for interest in data products, even with limited information.', 'confidence': 'Low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '$2,500', 'reason': 'The product has a small capacity and a short data life, which typically lowers its value. However, it shows a reasonable model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 and a low data entropy, indicating that it may have some utility in specific applications. The market score of 0.3 suggests limited demand, further impacting the price. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a balance between potential utility and market limitations.', 'confidence': '70%'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 500. The absence of critical traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market makes it difficult to fully assess the value of the product, so I believe a lower starting price is reasonable.
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 600. Given the product's reasonable model performance improvement and low data entropy, I believe this price reflects its potential utility despite the limitations in capacity and market demand.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 550. I believe this price reflects the reasonable model performance and low data entropy mentioned, while also accounting for the limitations in capacity and market demand. This offer balances the insights gathered from the analysts while positioning us for a fair deal.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 580. This price strikes a balance between the previous offers and reflects the reasonable model performance, while also factoring in the limitations in capacity and market demand. It's a fair position that recognizes the value of the data product while still being competitive.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 570. Given the reasonable model performance and low data entropy, this price reflects a competitive stance while recognizing the product¡¯s inherent value despite its limitations.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 590. This price strikes a balance between recognizing the reasonable model performance and the low data entropy, while also enhancing the product¡¯s perceived value in the market. It reflects a competitive stance that I believe is fair for both parties involved.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 580. I believe this price strikes a fair balance, acknowledging the reasonable model performance and low data entropy while remaining competitive in the current market.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 600. This price reflects the reasonable model performance and low data entropy, while also acknowledging the competitive market landscape. I believe it fairly represents the value of the data product and positions us well for a successful transaction.
Round 5 (Buyer): I offer 590. This price acknowledges the reasonable model performance and low data entropy while remaining competitive in the current market landscape. It reflects the value of the data product without overshooting the previous offers.
Round 5 (Seller): I offer 610. This price reflects the consistent performance and ongoing demand for the data product while also considering the competitive landscape we've seen in previous offers. It's a fair acknowledgment of the model's capabilities and its market value.
Round 6 (Buyer): I offer 600. This price reflects the model's reasonable performance and low data entropy while remaining competitive in today's market landscape. I believe this offer acknowledges the data product's true value while aligning with the latest assessments from analysts.
Round 6 (Seller): I offer 620. This price reflects the enhanced perceived value of the model and its competitive positioning in the current market landscape, while still acknowledging the reasonable performance and low data entropy noted by analysts.
Round 7 (Buyer): I offer 610. Given the consistent market demand and reasonable performance of the data product, I believe this price reflects its value while remaining competitive.
Round 7 (Seller): I offer 610. The data product demonstrates reasonable performance and low data entropy, and this price reflects its true value while remaining competitive in the market.
