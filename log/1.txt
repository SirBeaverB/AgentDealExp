{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The lack of available traits significantly limits the ability to assess the product's true value, which typically would be based on performance metrics and market demand. However, a base price is suggested due to the potential application of data products in various industries.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to potential users. However, the data life being short and the presence of several NULL traits, particularly regarding capacity and data entropy, suggests limited long-term value and utility. The market score of 0.3 indicates some demand, but overall the uncertainty due to missing data traits lowers confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1657.5
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in performance indicated by the model performance improvement of 0.2, which makes the data product appealing to potential users despite its short data life and some NULL traits. I believe this price captures the product's potential value effectively.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. Given the limited data traits and the short data life, I believe a lower price is more appropriate to reflect the product's actual value.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. I believe this price better reflects the value of the performance improvement of 0.2, while also considering the buyer's concerns regarding the data traits and lifespan. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both the product's appeal and the buyer's position.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1650. While I appreciate the seller's position on the performance improvement, I still believe the limited data traits and short lifespan justify a lower price. 1650 strikes a balance that respects both our perspectives.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1670. The performance improvement and the unique features of the product justify a competitive price, while still being flexible enough to meet the buyer's concerns about the data traits and lifespan. Let's find a middle ground that reflects the value of this offering.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1650. The limited data traits and short lifespan still present significant concerns that must be addressed, and my offer reflects a fair compromise considering those factors. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1660. This price reflects the strong value of our product's performance improvement while also addressing the buyer's concerns about data limitations. I believe this is a fair compromise that recognizes both the product's strengths and the buyer's reservations.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 1655. While I recognize the value of the product's performance improvement, my concerns about the limited data traits and short lifespan still stand. This price reflects my willingness to negotiate while remaining mindful of those reservations.
