Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle a reasonable volume of data or workload. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market limits the assessment, making it difficult to gauge its full potential and appeal. Therefore, I have assigned a moderate price based on the available trait that indicates some level of capability.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1200', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it can provide some added value in its application. The 'enough' capacity suggests it can handle the necessary data loads, while the medium data entropy indicates a reasonable complexity level for analysis. However, the short data life may limit its long-term usability, and the market score of 0.4 suggests a moderate demand. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a balance between the benefits and limitations.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
