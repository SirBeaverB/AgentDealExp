Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': "The absence of key traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market significantly limits the ability to assess the product's value. Without this information, it is challenging to determine the product's utility or market position, leading to a conservative estimate.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.3 is a decent indicator of potential efficacy, and while the market score of 0.5 suggests moderate demand, the short data life and lack of other trait information limit the overall value. The absence of capacity and data entropy further reduces confidence in scalability and applicability, leading to a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
