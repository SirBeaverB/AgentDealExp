Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a moderate enhancement in performance which can be valuable, especially if the market demand is also rated at 0.3. However, the high data entropy indicates variability and complexity in the data, which could affect usability. The lack of data life and history limits the understanding of the product's long-term viability and performance track record. Given these factors, the price reflects the potential while acknowledging the uncertainties.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing in certain markets. High data entropy suggests that the product has diverse and potentially valuable information. However, the medium data life implies that the data may not be as timely or relevant in the long run. The market score of 0.3 indicates limited demand, which affects the overall valuation. Given these factors, a price of 7500 reflects the product's moderate strengths while accounting for its limitations.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
