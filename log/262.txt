{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data entropy and sufficient capacity, which indicates that it can handle data well despite not having performance improvement metrics or data life information. The market value of 0.4 suggests there is some demand, but it is relatively low, indicating that the product may not be highly sought after. Therefore, the price is set at a moderate level.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates that it has the potential to enhance performance, albeit not significantly. The capacity is adequate, and the data life is long, which adds to the product's longevity and usability. The medium data entropy suggests a reasonable level of data complexity, which can appeal to certain markets. The market rating of 0.4 indicates there is some demand, but not overwhelming. Overall, the combination of these traits suggests a product that can provide value, albeit at a moderate price point.", 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 6000. This price reflects the product's moderate Model Performance Improvement and adequate capacity, indicating its potential to enhance performance for specific markets. The long data life and reasonable complexity add to its overall value, making it a worthwhile investment despite the moderate demand.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1000. The product's moderate data entropy and the market value suggest that its demand is relatively low. Given these factors, I believe a much lower price is warranted to reflect its actual value and potential.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 5000. The value of the product remains strong despite the moderate performance, and I believe this is a fair adjustment that reflects both the quality and the current market conditions.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 4900. The seller's offer of 5000 is close, but I still see the need for a slight reduction based on the moderate performance and current demand. This price reflects my confidence in the product while also considering the market conditions.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 5100. Given the moderate performance improvements and current market sentiment, this price reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while still addressing the buyer's concerns about demand.
