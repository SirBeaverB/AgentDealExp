Buying Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which suggests some level of effectiveness that could be beneficial in specific applications. However, the short data life and lack of historical context or market information limit its overall value. The capacity being "enough" indicates it can handle a certain level of data, but without more details on the target market or potential use cases, the confidence in this valuation is tempered.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 which indicates it may enhance existing models, but the high data entropy suggests complexity and potential difficulties in usability. The short data life limits its long-term application, while the market score of 0.3 indicates a relatively low demand or adoption potential, leading to a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
