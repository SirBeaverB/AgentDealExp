Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates some level of enhancement, which can be appealing to potential users in a competitive market. However, the short data life and several NULL traits suggest limitations in the product's overall utility and longevity. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, which supports a reasonable valuation but also reflects uncertainty.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement to existing models, which could appeal to some segments of the market, particularly those looking to optimize performance without extensive investments. However, the short data life and missing traits such as capacity and data entropy limit the product's overall value. The market score of 0.5 suggests there is some demand, but not overwhelming. Given these factors, a price of 1500 reflects a cautious optimism based on limited but promising traits.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
