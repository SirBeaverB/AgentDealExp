Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating that it has the potential to enhance performance. However, the high Data Entropy suggests that the data is complex and may require considerable effort to interpret and utilize effectively. The lack of information regarding Data Life, History, and Market reduces confidence in the overall value, but the strong MPI can still justify a moderate price in a niche market.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model accuracy, which can be attractive to potential users. However, the high data entropy suggests complexity and variability in the data, which may limit its usability. The short data life could indicate that the product is not sustainable long-term, impacting its value. The market score of 0.3 suggests a limited demand, which also constrains pricing. Overall, these factors contribute to a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in model accuracy indicated by the model performance improvement, alongside the complexity and variability in the data, which adds value to potential users despite some limitations.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. While I recognize the potential value in the data due to its model performance improvement, the complexities and uncertainties surrounding its interpretation and market applicability warrant a more conservative approach in pricing.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. The unique complexities and inherent uncertainties of the data justify a moderate price increase, ensuring value while aligning closely with the buyer's previous offer.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1650. Given the complexities and uncertainties highlighted by the seller, I believe this price reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the value of the data. It allows us to move closer to an agreement without overshooting the mark.
