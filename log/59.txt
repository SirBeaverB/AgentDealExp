Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life, which adds value as it can be utilized over an extended period. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, History, and Market limits the overall assessment. Given these factors, a moderate value is suggested.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance, which can be appealing to potential customers. However, the NULL values for capacity, data entropy, and history raise concerns about the product's completeness and reliability. The long data life adds value, but the overall uncertainty due to missing traits suggests a cautious valuation. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, which also supports a moderate price point.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
