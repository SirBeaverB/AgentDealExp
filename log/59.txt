Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable to users seeking to optimize their models. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle a reasonable amount of data, making it applicable for many businesses. However, the lack of information regarding data entropy, history, and market reduces the confidence in the overall valuation. Given these factors, I estimate a moderate price point.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a modest enhancement over existing solutions, while the low data entropy suggests the data is consistent and reliable. The capacity being adequate is a positive trait, though the medium data life and a market score of 0.3 suggest limited demand. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a balanced assessment of performance and market potential.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
