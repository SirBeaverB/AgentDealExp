Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in effectiveness, which is valuable for users looking to optimize their processes. However, the short data life may limit its long-term utility and the absence of market data and other traits reduces confidence in the product's viability. Therefore, the price reflects a balance between its performance benefits and the uncertainties present.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can attract interest from potential buyers. The capacity is sufficient, suggesting that the product can handle the expected data load. However, the low data entropy may imply limited complexity in the data, which could reduce its appeal for more advanced applications. The short data life suggests that the product may not have long-term utility, which could negatively impact its value. The market score of 0.4 indicates a moderate level of demand for similar products. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a balance between moderate performance improvement and potential limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
