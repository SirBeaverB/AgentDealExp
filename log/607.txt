Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) which indicates it can enhance performance to some degree. However, the data life is short, which may limit its long-term utility, and the medium data entropy suggests there is a reasonable level of uncertainty in the data. The lack of historical performance and market information creates uncertainty, but the existing traits still provide some value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a reasonable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating that it can enhance existing models. The capacity is sufficient, and the medium data entropy suggests a moderate level of complexity and variability in the data, which can be valuable. However, the short data life and lack of historical data may limit long-term usability and value. The market score of 0.4 indicates a modest demand. Overall, these factors suggest a product that has some value but is constrained by its limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
