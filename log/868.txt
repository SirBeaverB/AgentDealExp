Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and a market factor of 0.3, indicating some level of demand. However, the short data life and multiple NULL traits limit its potential. This suggests a moderate price reflecting these limitations.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in outcomes, while the low data entropy suggests that the data is relatively stable and reliable. However, the short data life may limit the product's long-term usability. The market factor of 0.3 indicates a niche demand. Overall, with a decent balance of strengths and weaknesses, the price reflects a fair value for a product with moderate performance in a limited market.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
