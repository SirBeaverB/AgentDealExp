Buying Valuer:
{'price': '8000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which suggests it can provide substantial value to users looking to enhance their models. Additionally, the capacity is adequate, and the data life is long, indicating sustainability and utility over time. However, the high data entropy could imply that the data is complex, which might require more effort to utilize effectively. The market value of 0.4 suggests moderate demand. Given these factors, the price reflects a balance between the potential benefits and the challenges.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.25 indicates a significant enhancement in the product's capabilities, which is attractive to potential buyers. A high data entropy suggests that the data is rich and complex, offering more insights. The long data life implies that the data will remain relevant for an extended period, adding to its value. However, the market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, and the lack of historical data reduces the confidence somewhat. Overall, the product has valuable traits that can justify a mid-range price.", 'confidence': 'moderate'}
