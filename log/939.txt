Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a significant enhancement in performance, which is valuable for potential users. However, the lack of data on entropy, history, and market limits the confidence in the valuation. The medium data life suggests the product will remain relevant for a reasonable duration, contributing to its value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a significant enhancement in performance, which is appealing in the current market where efficiency is valued. The low data entropy suggests that the data is clean and reliable, adding to its value. Although the history is NULL, the medium data life implies that the data can still be useful for a reasonable period. The market score of 0.4 indicates some demand, although it is not extremely high. Overall, the strengths in performance and data reliability can justify a mid-range price in the market.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
