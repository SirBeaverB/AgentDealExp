Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'high'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product has enough capacity and a long data life, which are positive attributes. However, the high data entropy suggests complexity and potential challenges in utilization. The market demand is relatively low at 0.3, indicating limited interest or competition. Given these factors, the product's value is moderate, leaning towards the lower end due to the high data entropy and the NULL traits which reduce overall confidence.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model effectiveness, which could appeal to businesses looking for solutions to optimize their data usage. The "high" data entropy suggests the product handles diverse data types well, adding value. The long data life also implies sustainability and long-term usability, which are attractive to potential buyers. However, the market score of 0.3 indicates a relatively low demand, which can limit the price. The absence of historical data is a concern, reducing confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the substantial value of the data product, considering its moderate enhancement in model effectiveness and its ability to handle diverse data types effectively. The long data life contributes to its appeal for long-term usage, making it a worthwhile investment for businesses aiming to optimize their data strategies.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400. The offered price is higher than my valuation, and while the data product has appealing attributes, the high data entropy and low market demand suggest a more conservative pricing approach. My offer reflects the need for a fair assessment of its moderate value in the current market context.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1500. This price reflects a balanced approach considering the effectiveness and long-term use valued by the buyer, while still addressing my concerns about data entropy and market demand. Let's move forward with this negotiation.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1450. I believe this price strikes a fair balance between the value I see in the data product and the concerns around data entropy and market demand that have been raised. I'm confident this offer reflects the potential for a beneficial agreement for both parties.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1480. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our previous discussions, recognizing the buyer's willingness to invest while still considering the market dynamics and value of the data product. Let's move closer to a deal.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1470. I believe this price reflects my continued commitment to finding common ground while still acknowledging the seller's perspective. It's slightly below the last offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate in good faith and move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.
