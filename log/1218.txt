Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle the required data loads, although the lack of information on other traits limits its potential appeal. The market score of 0.4 indicates a moderate demand, which could support a reasonable price, but the absence of performance improvement and other critical traits leads to a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates a potential for enhancing existing systems. Additionally, the market score of 0.4 suggests a moderate level of demand. However, the high data entropy and medium data life could imply variability in data quality and longevity. The lack of historical data limits the confidence in predicting future performance, but the available traits still indicate a reasonable value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
