Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to potential users. However, the short data life and lack of information on data entropy, history, and market limits the overall value. Given these factors, a moderate price is justified.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The product shows a decent Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it can enhance existing models. However, the high data entropy and short data life suggest that while the data may be valuable for short-term usage, its long-term applicability is limited. The market demand score of 0.4 implies a moderate interest, but the lack of historical data reduces confidence in its proven effectiveness. Overall, the expected price reflects its potential value while accounting for its limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
