Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and medium data entropy, which suggests it can handle a reasonable amount of data and provide valuable insights. However, the absence of information regarding model performance improvement, data life, history, and market limits the confidence in its overall value.

The capacity is sufficient, and the data life is long, suggesting durability and ongoing relevance. However, the data entropy is medium, indicating some variability in quality, and the market score of 0.3 suggests limited demand. Overall, the product has potential but is hindered by the lack of historical data, which affects its desirability.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
