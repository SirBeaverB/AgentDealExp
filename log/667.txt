Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to potential users. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle a reasonable amount of data or users. However, the lack of data entropy, history, and market information limits the overall confidence in the product\'s robustness and market potential. Given these factors, a mid-range price seems appropriate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.25 indicates a significant enhancement in performance, which is valuable in competitive markets. Given the medium data entropy and life, this product can provide consistent results over a reasonable time frame. The market score of 0.5 suggests moderate demand, which supports the pricing. However, the lack of historical data limits the confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the substantial enhancement in performance indicated by the model improvement of 0.25, which is highly valuable in competitive markets. Given the medium data entropy and life, this product promises consistent results over a reasonable timeframe, making it a worthwhile investment.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400. The moderate enhancement in performance with an MPI of 0.25 and the capacity being "enough" suggests some value, but the limitations in data entropy and history significantly impact my confidence in the product's robustness.
