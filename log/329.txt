Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a measurable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates a positive enhancement in performance metrics, making it potentially valuable. However, the lack of information on Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market limits the overall confidence in its market positioning and potential. Thus, the price reflects a moderate valuation considering the available data.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in effectiveness. The capacity being sufficient is a positive aspect, while high data entropy suggests that the data is diverse and potentially valuable. However, the short data life indicates that the product may have limited long-term utility, which could reduce its overall value. The market score of 0.5 suggests a moderate demand. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a balanced view of potential value versus limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
