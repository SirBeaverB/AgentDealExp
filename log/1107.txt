Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle a significant amount of data effectively over time. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data entropy, history, and market makes it difficult to assess its full potential and competitive standing. As such, the expected price reflects a cautious valuation based on the available positive traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product demonstrates a moderate model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates that it has the potential to enhance existing models, making it valuable in data-driven decision-making. The capacity is also sufficient, which is important for scalability. However, the medium data entropy suggests some complexity in the data, and the long data life implies that the product can be used for an extended period. The market score of 0.3 indicates some demand, but it is not robust. Overall, while there are strengths, the lack of historical data weakens the confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
