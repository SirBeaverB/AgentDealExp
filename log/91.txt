Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has a short data life, which typically suggests limited utility and demand. However, without significant traits available, the valuation remains speculative. Given the lack of other information, a conservative estimate is provided.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive in certain markets. However, the short data life and the presence of NULL for capacity, data entropy, and history suggest limitations in the product's overall utility and longevity. The market score of 0.5 implies there is some level of demand but not exceptionally high. These factors lead to a moderate valuation.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Deal Price:2200.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2500. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in performance indicated by the Model Performance Improvement of 0.25, while also considering the limitations suggested by the short data life and NULL values for capacity, data entropy, and history. I believe this price captures the value of the product effectively in the current market.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1900. Given the short data life and the uncertainties regarding utility and demand, I believe this price more accurately reflects the conservative value of the product.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 2300. This price reflects a balanced view considering the moderate performance improvements while accounting for the data limitations and uncertainties highlighted. It presents a fair opportunity for both parties to progress in this negotiation.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 2100. This price strikes a balance by acknowledging the moderate performance improvements while also considering the inherent uncertainties and limitations of the data. It presents a reasonable opportunity for both parties to move forward in this negotiation.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 2200. This price reflects a fair compromise between the various valuations based on moderate performance improvements and acknowledges the data limitations and uncertainties that have been discussed. I believe this offer is reasonable and should facilitate a productive negotiation.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 2200. This price reflects a fair balance considering the moderate performance improvements and the inherent data limitations we've discussed. It's a reasonable step towards finding common ground and advancing the negotiation.
