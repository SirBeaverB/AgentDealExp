Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates a moderate improvement in performance. The market score of 0.3 suggests there is some demand, but the lack of additional traits such as capacity, data entropy, data life, and history reduces the overall confidence in the valuation. Given these factors, a price around 1500 reflects the potential value while accounting for uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement, which can be valuable in specific applications. However, the lack of additional traits such as Capacity and Data Entropy, combined with a short Data Life and limited market data, suggests that while there is some potential, the overall value is constrained. The estimated price reflects a balance between the moderate performance improvement and the uncertainty introduced by the missing traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
