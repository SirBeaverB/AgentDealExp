Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 suggests a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing to businesses looking to optimize their data products. However, the lack of additional information such as Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market significantly limits the valuation due to uncertainty in the product's applicability and demand. Given the reasonable MPI and sufficient capacity, the price reflects a balance between potential value and the uncertainty from the missing traits.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '8000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates its effectiveness. The capacity is sufficient, and the data life is long, suggesting it can provide value over time. The low data entropy implies that the data is well-structured and reliable. However, the market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand. While the lack of history is a concern, the positive traits outweigh this factor.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
