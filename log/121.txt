Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The data product lacks key traits that are essential for a comprehensive valuation, such as Model Performance Improvement and market data. As a result, while there may be some inherent value, it is significantly limited due to the lack of information. The expected price reflects a basic valuation, acknowledging potential interest but lacking the robustness usually associated with well-defined products.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a significant enhancement over previous models, suggesting it could drive efficiency and effectiveness in its application. However, the NULL values in capacity, data entropy, and history limit the overall understanding and potential of the product. The long data life is a positive aspect contributing to its value. The market demand is relatively low at 0.3, indicating that while the product has some merit, it may not be highly sought after. Thus, the expected price reflects a balance of these factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
