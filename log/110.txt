Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 suggests a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in a competitive market. The market indicator of 0.4 indicates a reasonable demand, although the absence of several traits (capacity, data entropy, data life, and history) limits the overall understanding of the product's value. Nevertheless, the existing traits imply potential utility in improving data models, justifying a moderate price.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in model efficiency, which can attract interest in markets looking for performance boosts. However, the NULL values for capacity, data entropy, and history limit the product's appeal and transparency, reducing its overall value. The medium data life suggests it can still be relevant for some time, but the market demand score of 0.4 indicates only moderate interest. Given these factors, a price of 1500 reflects a cautious approach to its valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in model efficiency indicated by the Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which can attract interest from buyers looking for performance boosts, despite some limitations in the product.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 2200. This price takes into account the moderate enhancement in model performance and reflects my willingness to recognize the potential utility of the data product, while still being cautious given the limitations observed.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 2000. Given the moderate model performance improvement and acknowledging the product limitations, I believe this price reflects a fair value while also allowing for a reasonable negotiation margin. Let's work towards a deal that satisfies both parties.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 2000. This price reflects a balanced assessment of the moderate model performance improvement while taking into account the product limitations. It allows us to find a satisfactory agreement without straying too far from what is reasonable for both parties. Let¡¯s move forward!
