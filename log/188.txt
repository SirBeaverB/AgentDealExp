Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life which indicates it retains some relevance over time, and the market score of 0.5 suggests a moderate demand. However, the lack of detailed information on model performance, capacity, and data entropy limits the potential value. Therefore, the expected price reflects a cautious valuation based on available traits.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to potential users. The market score of 0.5 suggests there is a decent demand for similar products. However, the NULL values for capacity and data entropy limit the assessment of the product's overall utility and robustness, which lowers the expected price. The medium data life suggests it has a reasonable longevity, contributing positively to its value.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
