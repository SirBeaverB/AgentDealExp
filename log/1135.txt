Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance, which can attract interest in certain markets. The "enough" capacity and "long" data life suggest the product is sustainable, while medium data entropy implies a moderate level of complexity. However, the lack of historical data and market information limits confidence in the product¡¯s potential value. Given these factors, a mid-range price is justified.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which could attract users seeking efficiency gains. The capacity being sufficient and a long data life add value, suggesting that the product can support prolonged use. However, the medium data entropy may imply some complexity in data handling. The market score of 0.4 suggests moderate demand, which could stabilize the pricing. Overall, while some traits are missing (e.g., History), the existing qualities indicate a reasonable valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
