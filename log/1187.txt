Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has adequate capacity, which suggests it can handle a reasonable amount of data, but its short data life indicates limited use or longevity. The absence of other traits leaves significant uncertainties, but there is still some value in its capacity, which can be appealing in specific use cases.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it can enhance performance effectively. However, the high data entropy suggests that the data may be complex or noisy, which could limit its usability. The short data life reduces long-term value, but the market demand score of 0.5 indicates a moderate level of interest. Given these factors, the price reflects a balance between potential performance benefits and the limitations presented by data quality and lifespan.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
