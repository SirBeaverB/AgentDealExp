Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and sufficient capacity, which suggests it can be used effectively over time and handle a reasonable amount of data. However, the market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand. The NULL traits, particularly Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy, introduce uncertainty, but the long data life suggests it could still hold value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating it can enhance existing models effectively. Additionally, it has a long data life and low data entropy, which suggests that the data is stable and reliable for long-term use. However, the market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, which tempers the price expectation. Overall, the combination of these traits suggests a solid value for the product, particularly for enterprises looking to improve their data models.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
