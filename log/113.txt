Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': "The lack of available traits makes it difficult to assess the product's value accurately. However, there may still be some minimal value based on potential market interest or the possibility of future data being collected.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates that it can enhance certain metrics effectively. However, the lack of specific information regarding capacity and data entropy limits the overall assessment of its capabilities. The medium data life suggests decent usability, and the market score of 0.5 indicates a reasonable demand. Considering these factors, a price of 1500 reflects a balance of potential value while accounting for the uncertainties indicated by the NULL traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
