Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': "The market rating is relatively low at 0.3, indicating limited demand or interest in the product. Additionally, the absence of key traits such as Model Performance Improvement and others raises uncertainty about the product's capabilities and value. Therefore, a conservative estimated price is justified.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The product shows a notable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it can significantly enhance existing systems or models. Additionally, a long data life suggests that the product has sustained value over time. However, the presence of NULL traits, particularly in capacity and data entropy, introduces uncertainty regarding its overall applicability and robustness in various scenarios. The market score of 0.3 indicates limited demand, which further tempers the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:19000.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 20000. This price reflects the significant Model Performance Improvement of 0.2, which can greatly enhance existing systems, as well as the long-term value of the data product. Despite some uncertainties due to NULL traits, I believe the product's potential justifies a premium valuation.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 800. Given the low market rating of 0.3 and the lack of key traits, I believe this price more accurately reflects the product's current value and demand constraints.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 19000. I believe this reflects the significant improvement in model performance and the long-term value of the data product, while still being a fair adjustment considering the previous offers.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 19000. This reflects my recognition of the significant model performance improvement and the long-term value of the data product, while also being a strategic move to bridge the gap between our previous offers.
