Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product has a sufficient capacity, and despite the market score being relatively low at 0.3, there is still some demand present. However, the lack of information regarding Model Performance Improvement and other critical traits limits the reliability of the product's value. Thus, a moderate price reflecting potential but acknowledging uncertainty is appropriate.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': 'The product shows a decent Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it can provide some value in improving model outcomes. The low data entropy suggests that the data is relatively clean and structured, which is favorable for analysis. However, the market demand is relatively low at 0.3, which limits its potential value. The medium data life suggests it may be relevant for a reasonable period but not exceptionally long. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a moderate valuation, with the market demand being a limiting factor.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
