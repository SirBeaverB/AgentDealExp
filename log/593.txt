Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle a decent amount of data or usage. However, the lack of information about Model Performance Improvement and other traits limits the overall confidence in its capabilities. Given that there is some utility but significant uncertainty, a moderate price is justified.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance performance to some extent. The capacity is sufficient, which is a positive trait. However, the medium data entropy suggests that there may be some variability in data quality, and the short data life limits the product's usefulness over time. The market value of 0.4 indicates a lower demand or competitive landscape. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a moderate expected price.", 'confidence': '70%'}
