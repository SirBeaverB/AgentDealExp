{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. However, the short data life and lack of historical data suggest that the product may not have long-term viability or extensive application. The market size rating of 0.3 shows potential demand, but the overall uncertainty due to NULL traits affects confidence. Thus, a moderate price reflects these factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which suggests it can enhance existing models moderately. However, the low data entropy indicates that the data is relatively uniform and potentially less valuable for diverse applications. The short data life suggests it may not be useful for long-term projects, which could limit its appeal. The market value of 0.3 indicates a lower demand or competitive landscape. The combination of these traits leads to a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the potential of the data product to enhance existing models, despite some limitations in data entropy and life span. Given its moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, I believe this price captures the value while also considering the current market dynamics.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. While I recognize the potential of the data product and its moderate MPI, I believe the price should reflect the limitations in data lifespan and uncertainty due to NULL traits. A price of 1600 accounts for these factors while still acknowledging the value it can provide.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. This price reflects a fair compromise considering the data product's potential while acknowledging its limitations. Let's move forward with this mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price strikes a balance between recognizing the value of the data product and addressing the concerns about its limitations. It allows us to move forward while still being fair to both parties.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1750. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between the data product's inherent value and the buyer's concerns regarding its limitations. This allows us to move forward while acknowledging both perspectives.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1700. I believe this price strikes a fair compromise, acknowledging the value of the data product while also considering the potential limitations it may have. This allows us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1725. This price reflects a fair acknowledgment of the data product's potential while considering its limitations. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 1710. This price demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while recognizing the inherent value of the data product. I believe it strikes a suitable balance between our perspectives and moves us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.
