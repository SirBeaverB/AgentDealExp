Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The market value is at 0.5, indicating a moderate level of demand. However, the lack of specific traits (all being NULL except for the market) limits the potential performance and reliability of the product, which suggests a lower price point.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating that it can enhance existing models effectively. The long data life suggests it can be used for extended periods, adding to its value. However, the lack of information in other traits, particularly Capacity and Data Entropy, limits the overall assessment. The market value of 0.5 indicates some demand, but the uncertainty from NULL traits reduces confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
