Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a decent enhancement, which could attract interest from businesses looking to improve their data products. While the capacity is sufficient and data entropy is low (suggesting a more reliable dataset), the presence of multiple NULL traits (data life, history, market) introduces uncertainty about the product's long-term viability and market demand. Thus, the valuation reflects a moderate interest level with potential for improvement.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which could attract interest. The low data entropy suggests that the data is clear and reliable, while a long data life indicates that it can be used for an extended period without degradation. However, the market score of 0.3 indicates limited demand or competitive saturation. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a balance between potential value and market conditions.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
