Buying Valuer:

Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate level of effectiveness, which can be valuable in certain segments of the market. However, the lack of data on capacity, data entropy, and history limits the potential applications and understanding of the product's full capabilities. The medium data life suggests it has a reasonable longevity but doesn't significantly boost its value. Given these factors, a conservative price is warranted.", 'confidence': 'low'}
