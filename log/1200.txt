Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 0.3), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'high'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in certain markets. The capacity is sufficient, which suggests that the data product can handle the necessary workloads. However, the high data entropy and short data life suggest that while the data may be diverse and rich in information, it may not be stable or long-lasting, which could limit its long-term value. The market score of 0.5 indicates a moderate demand. Therefore, the expected price is reflective of these factors, balancing the potential benefits against the limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a moderate enhancement in predictive power, which can be valuable in certain applications. The market score of 0.5 indicates a moderate level of demand. However, the high data entropy suggests variability and complexity in the data, which may require sophisticated handling. The short data life implies that the product will need frequent updates or replacements, which could affect long-term value. Given these factors, a price of 2000 reflects moderate potential while accounting for the associated risks.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:No deal.
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2500. This price reflects the unique value of the data product, considering its moderate performance improvement, demand, and the complexity it presents. The higher price accounts for the potential risks associated with data entropy and the necessity for frequent updates, positioning it as a strategic investment.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1300. Considering the high data entropy and short data life, which limit the long-term value of the product, I believe my offer reflects a fair assessment of its potential risks. While the performance improvement is valuable, it does not warrant the initial asking price of 2500.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 2400. The unique value of this data product, along with its potential for strategic investment, justifies a price that reflects its quality and relevance in the market.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1500. The data product's high entropy and potential for limited long-term value necessitate a more reasonable price. While I recognize its unique qualities, my valuation reflects the current market realities and the associated risks.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 2300. This price reflects a balance between the data product's unique value and the market feedback I've received, while still aiming for a strategic investment that acknowledges the buyer's concerns about high entropy and limited long-term value.

Round 4 (Seller): I offer 2200. The data product possesses significant unique value and potential for strategic investment, and I believe this adjusted price reflects its worth while still acknowledging the buyer's concerns about high data entropy.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 2000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the seller's valuation of the data product and my concerns about its high entropy and limited long-term value. This offer acknowledges the unique potential of the product while also being mindful of the risks involved.
Round 5 (Seller): I offer 2100. This price reflects the unique value of the data product while acknowledging the buyer's concerns about high data entropy and potential risks. It represents a fair compromise, considering both the product's potential and the buyer's position.
Round 5 (Buyer): I offer 2000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise, taking into account the seller's acknowledgment of the high data entropy and potential risks while still recognizing the product's unique value. It's a reasonable offer that aligns with our previous negotiations and aims for a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 6 (Seller): I offer 2050. This price reflects the unique value of the data product while taking into consideration the buyer's concerns regarding high entropy. I'm confident this is a fair middle ground that recognizes both the product's potential and the need for a reasonable compromise.
Round 6 (Buyer): I offer 2000. I believe this price strikes a fair balance between acknowledging the seller's recognition of the product's potential while still taking into account my concerns regarding high entropy and limited long-term value. This is a reasonable compromise that reflects the ongoing negotiation dynamics.
Round 7 (Seller): I offer 2050. I believe this price reflects the unique value of the data product while addressing the buyer's concerns about high entropy. It's a fair compromise that recognizes both the product's potential and the buyer's position.
Round 7 (Buyer): I offer 2000. I believe this price strikes a balance between recognizing the data product's potential value and my ongoing concerns about high entropy. It reflects a fair compromise that addresses both parties' positions while remaining mindful of the risks involved.
Round 8 (Seller): I offer 2020. I believe this price reflects the unique value of the data product while considering the buyer's ongoing concerns about entropy. It provides a fair opportunity for both parties to move forward in this deal.
Round 8 (Buyer): I offer 1900. I believe this price strikes a balance between acknowledging the seller's concerns about the product's value while still addressing my ongoing apprehensions regarding high data entropy and its limited long-term viability.
