{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and a medium level of data entropy, indicating it can handle a reasonable amount of data and is somewhat complex. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data life, history, and market limits the potential value. Given these factors, the price reflects a moderate valuation based on the available traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a decent potential for performance enhancement, which is valuable in many markets. The medium data entropy and life suggest that while the data is not cutting-edge, it is still relevant and usable. The market value of 0.4 indicates a reasonable demand, but the lack of historical data may limit the perceived reliability. Overall, there is sufficient value in the product, especially given the market context.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800.

Given its medium entropy and relevance, I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
