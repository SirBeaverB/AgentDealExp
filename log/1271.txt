Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and sufficient capacity, which suggests it can be valuable for long-term projects or applications. However, the high data entropy indicates that the data may be complex or less structured, which could limit its immediate usability. The lack of information on model performance improvement and market conditions introduces uncertainty, but the other traits still provide a foundation for value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates its effectiveness in enhancing model outcomes. The high data entropy suggests that the data is diverse and potentially useful for various applications. Additionally, a long data life indicates that the data can be used over an extended period, which adds to its value. However, the lack of historical data limits the confidence in predicting future performance. The market demand of 0.4 suggests moderate interest but does not indicate overwhelming competition, allowing for a reasonable price point.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
