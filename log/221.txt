Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can add value to the product. However, the lack of information regarding data life, history, and market significantly limits the valuation, as these traits are crucial for understanding the long-term viability and demand for the product. Given the medium data entropy and sufficient capacity, the product can still be useful, but the uncertainty from the NULL traits affects overall confidence.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating some level of effectiveness. The capacity is deemed sufficient, which suggests that it can handle the required data volume. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate interest and demand. However, the medium data entropy and medium data life suggest that while the product is functional, it may not offer exceptional long-term value. Overall, the traits combine to present a product with potential utility, but not without limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 7000. This price reflects the potential utility of the data product, considering its Model Performance Improvement of 0.2 and moderate market interest. While there are some limitations, the overall value justifies a higher starting point.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1500. Given the moderate enhancement in performance with a Model Performance Improvement of 0.2, I believe this price reflects the value while considering the uncertainties surrounding the data¡¯s life, history, and market demand. The limitations present a significant risk that must be accounted for in our negotiation.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 2500. This amount reflects the significant utility and potential of the data product while still considering the performance improvements and market demand risks I previously mentioned.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 2400. The data product has notable potential and utility, but I need to account for the performance improvements and risks mentioned by the seller. This price reflects a fair compromise while still valuing the product.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 2600. I believe this price reflects the value of the data product while considering the improvements in performance and the potential it holds. It¡¯s a fair compromise that acknowledges the buyer's interest and the market dynamics at play.
