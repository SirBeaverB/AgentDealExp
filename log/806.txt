Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and high data entropy, which can be valuable in certain markets where data diversity and volume are critical. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Data Life, and History limits its potential, and the market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand. Therefore, while there is some value, it is not very high due to the uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance, which can attract users looking for effective solutions. The capacity being "enough" suggests that it can handle a decent workload, and while the data entropy is high, indicating complexity, it may also imply richness of insights. However, the medium data life and lack of historical data may affect long-term reliability, thus limiting the price somewhat. The market value of 0.5 suggests a moderate demand, which balances the other traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
