Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'Given that there is sufficient capacity for the data product, it indicates that it has a potential to handle a reasonable volume of data. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market limits the overall assessment. The expected price reflects a cautious valuation based on the available capacity while considering the uncertainty due to the missing traits.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in effectiveness, which can appeal to businesses seeking better data-driven decisions. The capacity being "enough" suggests it can handle a reasonable amount of data, and a long data life implies ongoing utility. However, the medium data entropy suggests variability in data quality, which may slightly temper the overall value. The market score of 0.3 indicates a low demand, which affects the valuation. Overall, the product has potential but is constrained by market conditions and data quality.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the enhanced effectiveness of the data product, which can significantly improve data-driven decisions for businesses, despite some variability in data quality. The ongoing utility and reasonable data handling capacity add to its value, making it a compelling investment.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. I believe this price reflects a cautious approach given the uncertainties surrounding the data product's performance metrics and the current market conditions. While the product has potential, the lack of comprehensive information necessitates a more conservative valuation.

Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our previous negotiations while also acknowledging the unique features and effectiveness of the data product. I'm eager to reach an agreement that suits both parties.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1680. This price reflects the unique value and advanced features of the data product, while also considering the buyer's previous offer of 1650, allowing us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1660. I believe this price acknowledges the value of the data product while still being reasonable given the seller's last offer of 1680. It's a step closer to a fair deal that benefits both parties.
