Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The data product has a short data life, which generally limits its usability and therefore its value. However, without additional traits such as market demand, capacity, or model performance, the valuation is constrained. The potential use case may still attract some buyers, allowing for a moderate price.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. However, the short data life and high number of NULL traits limit the product's long-term viability and appeal. Given the market score of 0.4, there is some demand, but the lack of detailed metrics makes this a cautious estimate.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
