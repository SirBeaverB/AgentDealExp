Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in the model's effectiveness, which can be valuable for businesses looking to improve their data-driven decisions. However, the absence of other critical traits such as Capacity, Data Entropy, and Data Life limits the ability to fully assess the product's potential value. Given the moderate MPI, the expected price reflects a valuable but cautious estimate.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a significant enhancement in the product's effectiveness, which is appealing in a competitive market where performance is crucial. However, the medium data life and the lack of additional data traits (like capacity or data entropy) suggest limitations that could impact its overall value and usability. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, which supports a reasonable price point.", 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the significant enhancement in model performance indicated by the MPI of 0.3, which is highly appealing in today¡¯s competitive market. This level of effectiveness justifies a premium, and I am confident that the value of this data product is well-aligned with this price point.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 2000. This price reflects a fair assessment of the model's moderate enhancement in performance indicated by the MPI of 0.3, while also considering the limitations in other critical traits. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1900. This price reflects the model's substantial performance enhancement while acknowledging the valid concerns about its limitations, thus providing a balanced value for both parties.

It strikes a balance between enhancing value for both parties and recognizing the competitive nature of this deal.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1980. This price reflects a strong acknowledgment of the significant performance enhancements while also considering the competitive landscape and inherent limitations. It strikes a balance that is fair and beneficial for both parties involved.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1970. This price reflects a strong appreciation for the significant performance enhancements while also considering the competitive landscape and the inherent limitations of the product. It balances value and fairness, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.
