Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity, which indicates it can handle data effectively, despite the high data entropy and short data life, which generally suggest challenges in data consistency and longevity. The lack of historical and market traits means that while there is potential value, it is difficult to fully assess the market demand, leading to a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates that it has the potential to enhance existing systems or models. However, the high data entropy suggests that the data may be less structured or harder to interpret, which could limit usability. The short data life implies that the product may not be suitable for long-term use, affecting its overall value. The moderate market score of 0.4 indicates some demand, but the lack of historical data makes it difficult to assess its true potential fully. Therefore, while there is promise, the limitations temper the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
