{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a decent enhancement in model performance, which can attract interest from buyers. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle typical workloads, and the medium data entropy indicates a balanced complexity which could be appealing for various applications. However, the NULL values for Data Life and History limit the understanding of the product\'s long-term viability and performance metrics, which may reduce its attractiveness slightly. The market score of 0.4 suggests a moderate demand. Overall, the product has potential value, but the NULL traits introduce some uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates that it could enhance existing models, appealing to users looking for performance gains. The capacity is sufficient, which supports usability in various applications. However, the data life is short and data entropy is medium, suggesting that while it may be useful temporarily, it might not hold long-term value. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, which also affects the pricing. Overall, considering these factors, a price of 1500 seems reasonable.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate Model Performance Improvement of the data product, which has the potential to enhance existing models significantly. Given the sufficient capacity and current market demand, I believe this price is justified for the value being provided, even with the short data life and medium entropy.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1500. The data product has potential, but the NULL values for Data Life and History introduce uncertainty that affects its long-term viability. A price of 1500 reflects my valuation considering the moderate performance improvement and the current market conditions.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1600. This price reflects the moderate performance improvement and justified value of the data product, while also considering the uncertainties from NULL values. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both the product's potential and its limitations.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1550. This price represents a balanced approach, acknowledging the seller's perspective on performance improvement while also addressing the concerns regarding NULL values. I believe this offer reflects a reasonable midpoint that honors the product's potential without overstating its value.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1575. The previous offers indicate we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, and this reflects a fair assessment of the product's moderate performance while taking into account the concerns about its long-term viability. Let's move forward with a reasonable compromise.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1560. This price reflects my recognition of the seller's perspective while also addressing the product's moderate performance and existing concerns. It¡¯s a step closer to a fair deal, and I'm confident this offer will bring us to a mutually beneficial agreement.
