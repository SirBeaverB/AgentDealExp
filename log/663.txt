Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and medium data entropy and life, which indicates it can provide reasonable insights. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement and history limits its overall potential and reliability. This suggests a moderate price point.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model shows a moderate improvement in performance (MPI of 0.25) and sufficient capacity, indicating it can handle current data needs. The medium data entropy and medium data life suggest a balance in data variability and usability over time. However, the lack of historical data limits insight into its long-term effectiveness. The market score of 0.5 suggests a moderate demand for this type of product. Overall, these factors indicate a reasonable value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
