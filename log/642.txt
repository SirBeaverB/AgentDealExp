Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has adequate capacity and a market score of 0.4, which indicates some level of demand, although the lack of information on key traits like Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy limits confidence in its potential value. Given these factors, a mid-range price is reasonable.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement to model performance, which is attractive to potential buyers. The capacity being "enough" suggests the product can handle adequate data loads. However, the medium data entropy and life indicate that while the data is valuable, it may not be as pristine or long-lasting as high-value products. The market score of 0.4 suggests there is some demand but not overwhelming. Overall, the product has decent traits that can appeal to specific segments, justifying a moderate price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
