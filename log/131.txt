{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The data product has a long data life, which suggests it could provide lasting value and relevance over time. However, the lack of information on other traits (such as model performance improvement, capacity, and data entropy) limits the ability to fully assess its potential. Hence, the valuation is conservative.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 suggests a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in a competitive market, especially given the market score of 0.4 indicating potential demand. However, several traits are NULL, which limits confidence in the full value assessment of the product.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
