{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.25 indicates a significant enhancement in effectiveness, which can attract buyers looking to improve their existing systems. However, the NULL traits (Data Entropy, History, Market) suggest a lack of critical information that could influence the product's overall value. Given the long data life, the product may have enduring relevance, but the missing traits limit the confidence in a higher valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates it has the potential to enhance outcomes effectively. The capacity being "enough" suggests it can handle its intended workload, while a long data life implies sustained usability over time. However, the high data entropy raises concerns about the data\'s consistency and reliability, and the market value of 0.4 suggests moderate demand. The lack of historical data is a downside, but the overall traits still justify a reasonable valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the significant model performance improvement of the data product, which can greatly enhance outcomes, along with its long data life that suggests sustained usability. While there are some concerns about data entropy, the overall potential and moderate market demand justify a higher starting price.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1500. The significant model performance improvement is appealing, but the concerns regarding data entropy and other NULL traits make me cautious about the overall value. I believe this price reflects a fair starting point for both parties to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
