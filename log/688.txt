{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.25 indicates a notable enhancement in effectiveness, which can be valuable in competitive markets. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle current demand. The medium data entropy and long data life indicate a balanced and sustainable product. However, the lack of historical data limits the ability to assess long-term performance, which slightly lowers the confidence in this valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates a valuable enhancement over existing solutions. The capacity is deemed sufficient, and the long data life suggests it can be used effectively over time. However, the medium data entropy indicates some complexity or variability in the data, which may require additional handling. The market score of 0.3 suggests a fair level of demand, but the lack of historical data limits the confidence in its overall market performance. Therefore, the expected price reflects a balance between its potential benefits and the uncertainties introduced by the traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate Model Performance Improvement of 0.25, which signifies valuable enhancements over existing solutions, and the sufficient capacity along with long data life. While there are some complexities indicated by the medium data entropy, the potential benefits and demand level justify a strong initial offer.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1500. While I recognize the value of the moderate Model Performance Improvement of 0.25 and the sufficient capacity, I believe my offer reflects the uncertainties regarding the historical data and its long-term performance. This price strikes a balance between value and the risks involved.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. I believe this price reflects a balanced consideration of the moderate Model Performance Improvement and the historical data uncertainties I previously mentioned. It presents a fair compromise that recognizes both the potential value of the data and the associated risks. Let's continue moving towards a successful agreement.
