Buying Valuer:
{'price': '10000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a decent enhancement over baseline models, which is appealing for organizations looking to improve their data-driven outcomes. However, the lack of information regarding capacity, data entropy, and history keeps the valuation moderate. The medium data life suggests some longevity in its relevance, but the uncertainty in other traits limits the potential price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance which can appeal to specific market segments. The medium data life suggests that the product can still be relevant in the market for some time. However, the NULL values for capacity, data entropy, and history limit the understanding of the product's full potential and market readiness. The market rating of 0.3 suggests a low overall demand, impacting the price negatively. Balancing these factors leads to a moderate price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:2900.0
Dealing Process:

This strategic pricing positions us favorably in the market.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 3000. This price reflects a slight increase from my initial offer, acknowledging the moderate enhancement in model performance while still considering the uncertainties related to capacity and data entropy. This strategic adjustment aims to facilitate progress in our negotiations.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 2800. This price reflects the balanced advantages of moderate model performance improvement and medium data life while considering the uncertainties highlighted in the previous discussions. It provides a fair value for the data product, ensuring both parties benefit from the deal.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 2900. This price reflects a fair assessment of the moderate model performance improvement and medium data life while considering the uncertainties in capacity and data entropy discussed previously. It strikes a balance that benefits both parties in this strategic deal.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 2900. I believe this price accurately reflects the moderate model performance improvement and the medium data life, while also addressing the uncertainties in the deal. It strikes a balance between fair assessment and the value we bring to the table.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 2850. I believe this price strikes a solid balance between the moderate model performance improvement and the medium data life, while also addressing the uncertainties that have been acknowledged in previous discussions. It reflects a fair assessment of the value we both bring to the table.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 2900. The previous offers reflect a balanced assessment of the model's performance and data life, and I believe this price accurately captures the value while addressing any uncertainties in the deal.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 2900. This price reflects a fair evaluation of the model's performance improvement and data life, while also taking into account the uncertainties we've discussed. It provides a balanced approach that aligns with the offers made by the analysts in the previous rounds.
