Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity, which indicates it can handle a reasonable amount of data processing or storage. However, the short data life suggests it may have limited applicability or longevity in the market. Given the NULL traits, there is a lack of detailed information on performance and historical data, which lowers overall confidence in the valuation. Despite this, a base value is attributed due to its capacity.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model efficiency, which can be attractive to users looking for better results. The capacity being "enough" suggests that it can handle a reasonable amount of data, albeit the short data life indicates it may not be suitable for long-term use. The medium data entropy suggests that while there is some complexity in the data, it¡¯s manageable. The market score of 0.3 indicates a low demand, which may limit potential pricing. Overall, the product has some useful features but is hindered by its short data life and low market score, leading to a moderate expected price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
