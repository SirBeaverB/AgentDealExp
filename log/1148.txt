{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 0.3), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable to many businesses seeking to optimize their data products. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle the required workloads, which is favorable. The long data life implies it can be used over an extended period, adding to its value. However, the null values for Data Entropy and History indicate some uncertainty about the data\'s complexity and past performance, which slightly dampens the confidence in the valuation. The market score of 0.5 shows a reasonable level of demand, reinforcing the expected price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a decent improvement in performance, which can attract buyers looking for efficiency. The capacity being "enough" suggests the product can handle the expected workload, and a long data life increases its value by indicating it can be useful over a longer period. However, the medium data entropy and a market score of 0.5 suggest that while there\'s potential, the product might not be in high demand. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a moderate price expectation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
