{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 0.3), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'high'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a significant enhancement, which can lead to better outcomes for users. However, the high data entropy suggests variability which could affect usability and predictability. The lack of information regarding data life, history, and market limits the confidence in this valuation, but the product still has potential based on MPI alone.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it can enhance existing models effectively. However, the high data entropy suggests the data may be complex and not straightforward to analyze. The long data life is a positive feature, suggesting that the data will remain relevant for a substantial period. The market score of 0.3 indicates moderate demand, so while there is potential, it is not overwhelming. The absence of historical data limits the confidence in the valuation, but the combination of the other traits suggests a reasonable price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 6000. This price reflects the significant Model Performance Improvement of 0.3, which showcases the data's ability to enhance existing models effectively. The complexity indicated by the high data entropy adds value, as does the long data life, ensuring its relevance for a substantial period. Given these strong features, I believe this price is justified.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 4800. The Model Performance Improvement is promising, but the high data entropy raises concerns about predictability and usability. Given the lack of detailed information on data life and history, a more cautious price is warranted.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 5200. I believe this price reflects a balanced assessment of the data's potential value while still addressing my concerns about high data entropy and the need for more information on data history. This price is a step towards finding common ground and moving forward in our negotiations.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 5100. I believe this price strikes a fair balance, acknowledging the seller's concerns while reflecting the value I see in the data. It allows us to make progress in our negotiations without significantly compromising on either side.
