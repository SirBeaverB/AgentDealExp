Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and a medium data life, which suggests that it can be useful for certain applications. However, the lack of specific metrics like Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy indicates that the product may not be at the forefront of technological advancement or differentiation. Given these factors, a moderate valuation is appropriate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product exhibits a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates it can enhance performance to some extent. The low data entropy suggests high quality and consistency in the data, while the medium data life indicates it is still relevant. However, the absence of historical data limits its proven effectiveness. The market score of 0.3 suggests a niche demand, which may affect pricing. Overall, the combination of these traits suggests a modest value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate Model Performance Improvement and the high quality and consistency of the data. The product is still relevant, and while there are some limitations, I believe this price captures its potential value in the market.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1500. While the data product has its merits, including moderate Model Performance Improvement, I believe that the limitations and lack of specific metrics necessitate a more conservative valuation. This price reflects a fair assessment considering the overall potential value in the market.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1600. This price reflects a reasonable compromise, taking into account the product's moderate performance improvement and the value it can bring. I believe this aligns well with both our assessments and paves the way for a fair deal.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1550. This price reflects my ongoing assessment of the product's value while acknowledging the seller's recent offer. It represents a fair midpoint that recognizes the moderate performance improvements while still being mindful of the limitations discussed earlier. I believe this offer will facilitate a productive negotiation.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1580. I believe this price reflects a fair assessment of the product's capabilities while recognizing its limitations, allowing us to move forward in the negotiation process.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1570. I believe this price strikes a balance between the seller's valuation and the product's capabilities while acknowledging the limitations discussed. This allows us to remain competitive and move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.
