Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has adequate capacity and low data entropy, which indicates it is stable and reliable for use. However, the short data life could limit its long-term value, and the NULL traits introduce uncertainty. Given the market score of 0.5, this suggests moderate demand, leading to a conservative price estimate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a moderate Market score of 0.5, indicating a decent demand. The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 suggests it can enhance performance, albeit modestly. However, the low Data Entropy and short Data Life may limit its long-term utility. The absence of historical data is a concern, but the current capacity being "enough" suggests it can still serve a purpose in the market. Overall, these factors balance out to a reasonable price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
