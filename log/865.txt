Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'Despite having many NULL traits, the product has enough capacity, which suggests that it could potentially serve a market need. However, the lack of information on model performance, data entropy, data life, and market conditions significantly limits the confidence in its valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model capabilities, which can attract interest in a competitive market, despite the low market score of 0.3. The capacity being "enough" suggests it can handle adequate data workloads. However, the low data entropy and short data life limit the long-term value. Overall, the product has potential but with limitations that affect its price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:5075.0
Dealing Process:
