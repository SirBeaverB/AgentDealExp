{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which could appeal to certain segments of the market. However, the lack of information on key traits such as Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market limits the overall valuation. Considering the potential for improvement and the fact that capacity is sufficient, a conservative estimate is reasonable.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product has a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating that it can enhance existing models effectively. Although the Data Entropy is high, suggesting complexity and potential value, the medium Data Life indicates it may not be viable for long-term use. The market value of 0.5 suggests there is demand, but the NULL history trait raises some concerns about the product's proven track record. Overall, the expected price reflects a balance between its positive traits and the uncertainties.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
