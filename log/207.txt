Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a significant enhancement in performance, which can be highly valuable in competitive markets, particularly if this improvement translates into tangible benefits for users. However, the lack of information on capacity, data entropy, history, and market limits the confidence in the valuation, but the long data life adds some value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance which could be valuable in competitive markets. The long data life suggests that the data product has lasting relevance, which can justify a higher price. However, the NULL traits create uncertainty about its overall capacity and data quality, limiting confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
