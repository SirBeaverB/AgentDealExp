{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has a short data life and a market score of 0.4, indicating limited demand or applicability. The NULL traits suggest a lack of critical performance information, which diminishes its overall value. However, a base price is assigned due to the presence of some market interest.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) value of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be appealing to potential users. However, the short data life and several NULL traits (like capacity and data entropy) limit the product's reliability and long-term value. The market score of 0.4 suggests a moderate demand but is not strong enough to significantly elevate the price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
