Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has medium data entropy and sufficient capacity, which suggests a moderate level of reliability and usability in the market. However, the lack of information regarding model performance improvement and data life limits its potential value. The market score of 0.5 indicates a balanced demand and supply situation, which can support a reasonable pricing estimate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate level of effectiveness in enhancing performance, which is a significant factor for potential buyers. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle the necessary workload. Although the data entropy and life are medium, which may not be ideal, they still present a reasonable level of reliability. The market score of 0.5 suggests a decent demand, but the absence of historical data is a drawback. Overall, these factors align to justify a mid-range pricing strategy.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
