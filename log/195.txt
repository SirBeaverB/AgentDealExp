Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The long data life suggests that the product could offer sustained value over time, which can be appealing to potential buyers, even in the absence of specific performance or capacity metrics. However, the lack of information on key traits limits the confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. However, the lack of available data on capacity, data entropy, and history limits the overall confidence in the product's capabilities. The long data life suggests that the product may have sustained relevance over time. Considering the market score of 0.3, which reflects moderate demand, the expected price is set at a reasonable level.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
