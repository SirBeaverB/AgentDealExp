Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and low data entropy, indicating stability and reliability, which are attractive traits in the market. However, the market score of 0.4 suggests limited demand, and the NULL traits indicate gaps in performance and history, which diminishes its overall value. Given these factors, the price is moderate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': "The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance model outcomes effectively. The capacity is sufficient, and the low data entropy suggests the data is structured and reliable. The long data life implies durability and continued relevance of the product. However, the market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, and the lack of historical data may hinder trust in the product's past performance. These factors balance the valuation towards a competitive price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
