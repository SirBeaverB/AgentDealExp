{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 0.3), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates that the product has a moderate level of performance enhancement. However, the short data life and multiple NULL traits suggest limitations in scalability and market readiness. The expected price reflects the potential value of the improvement while considering the risks associated with its short data lifespan and lack of comprehensive traits.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing in the market. However, the short data life and several NULL traits suggest limited long-term value. The market score of 0.3 reflects low demand, further capping the potential price.', 'confidence': 'low'}
