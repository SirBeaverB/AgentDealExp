Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'high'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating that it can enhance existing models' effectiveness in a meaningful way. The capacity is sufficient, which suggests that the product can handle the required workload. However, the high data entropy indicates that the data is complex and may require more effort to interpret. The medium data life can imply a decent usability duration, but the NULL traits for history and market limit the confidence in the product's overall stability and market acceptance. Therefore, the price reflects its potential value while accounting for the uncertainties.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product demonstrates a notable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates a good enhancement in performance. The capacity is sufficient, suggesting it can handle the necessary data loads. However, the high data entropy may complicate data interpretation and utilization. The medium data life suggests the data's relevance may not be long-lasting. Given the market demand at 0.3, the product may attract some interest, but the overall valuation is tempered by the presence of a NULL history, indicating a lack of historical performance data.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
