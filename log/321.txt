Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle the required data volume, but the absence of several key traits (MPI, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, Market) limits its overall value and marketability. The price reflects a conservative estimate based on available capacity, but the uncertainty surrounding the other traits reduces confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate improvement potential, combined with a market score of 0.5 suggesting a decent demand. However, the high data entropy and short data life may limit long-term usability and stability. Since there's only one trait marked as NULL, it shows some robustness in the value assessment.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
