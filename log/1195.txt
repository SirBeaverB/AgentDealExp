Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a significant enhancement in performance, which can be valuable to businesses looking to optimize their processes. However, the short data life and lack of data entropy, history, and market insights suggest limited longevity and potential applicability, which lowers the overall value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a reasonable enhancement over existing models, which can be attractive to users looking for better performance. However, the short data life and high data entropy indicate that while the product may offer immediate value, it may not provide long-term reliability or stability. The market score of 0.5 implies moderate demand, but the lack of historical data (NULL) limits the confidence in long-term performance. Thus, the price reflects a balance of potential value and inherent risks.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
