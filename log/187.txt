Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life, which suggests it can still provide some value for a limited period. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, History, and Market greatly limits the confidence in its overall effectiveness and applicability. The price reflects a cautious valuation based on the available trait.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate improvement, which suggests some value to users looking to enhance their models. However, the NULL traits related to capacity, entropy, and history hinder the overall assessment. The medium data life indicates that it could still be relevant for a while, but the market value of 0.5 suggests that demand may not be exceptionally high. Thus, the expected price reflects these moderate factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
