Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate improvement in performance, which can be appealing in data-driven markets. The market score of 0.5 suggests a medium level of demand for this type of product. However, the presence of multiple NULL traits indicates a lack of comprehensive data, which limits confidence in the valuation. Therefore, the expected price reflects the potential value while accounting for the uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a notable enhancement in performance, which is appealing in competitive markets. The long data life suggests sustainability and ongoing relevance. However, the NULL traits limit the overall understanding of the product's capacity and data entropy, which are crucial for a full assessment. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, which also supports a reasonable price point.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
