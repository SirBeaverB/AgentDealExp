Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a notable enhancement in performance, which could be attractive to potential users. However, the lack of additional information such as capacity, data entropy, data life, history, and market makes it difficult to gauge the full value and applicability of the product. Given the improvement, a moderate price is justified, but uncertainty due to the NULL traits limits confidence.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be appealing to potential users. However, the short data life and the presence of multiple NULL traits suggest limited long-term value and usability. Given the market score of 0.3, which indicates a lower demand, the expected price reflects a balance between the moderate improvement and the overall uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:5600.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 6000. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in model performance indicated by the Model Performance Improvement of 0.25, while also considering the potential limitations of the data's short life and the market score of 0.3. I believe this price captures the value of the data product effectively and is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 5000. This price aligns with my expectations based on the Model Performance Improvement of 0.25, while also accounting for the uncertainties surrounding the data's limitations and market score. I believe this is a fair and reasonable starting point for our negotiation.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 5500. Given the moderate model performance improvement and the existing data limitations highlighted by both analysts, this price strikes a balance that reflects the value of the product while considering the concerns raised.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 5700. I believe this price better reflects the moderate model performance improvement while addressing the data limitations mentioned by both analysts. It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product without overextending.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 5600. This price reflects the balance between the moderate improvements in model performance and the data limitations that have been highlighted. It positions us for a fair negotiation, acknowledging the concerns while still aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 5600. This price strikes a fair balance between the moderate improvements in model performance and the data limitations we've discussed, ensuring we remain aligned for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's move forward with this understanding.
