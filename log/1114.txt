Buying Valuer:

Given these factors, the price reflects a cautious valuation based on the available traits.", 'confidence': 'medium'}

However, the medium data entropy and the lack of historical data could limit its attractiveness to some buyers. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a balance between the product\'s strengths and its limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
