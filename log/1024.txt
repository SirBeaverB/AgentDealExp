Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a moderate level of enhancement, which could appeal to businesses looking for incremental gains. However, the data life being short and the market score being 0.3 indicate limited longevity and demand. The presence of medium data entropy might attract some interest, but the overall lack of historical data makes it difficult to predict long-term value. Therefore, while there is potential, the product's overall appeal is somewhat constrained.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement is moderately strong at 0.3, indicating that the product can provide some measurable benefits. However, the short data life and medium data entropy suggest that the product may have limited long-term value. The market score of 0.3 indicates low demand, which constrains pricing potential. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a conservative valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
