Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and medium data entropy, which suggests it can handle a reasonable volume of data and provide some insights. However, the short data life and multiple NULL traits indicate limitations in its long-term value and reliability. This results in a modest valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can attract interest in sectors seeking efficiency. The medium data entropy suggests that the data is somewhat complex but manageable, contributing positively to its value. However, the short data life implies that the product may not be sustainable over the long term, limiting its appeal. The market score of 0.3 shows a lower demand, which further tempers the expected price. Overall, the combination of these traits positions the product as valuable but with cautious optimism due to its short lifespan.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
