Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a positive enhancement, which can be valuable in data-driven applications. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle data requirements adequately. However, the presence of NULL traits indicates a lack of information regarding the product\'s historical performance, market context, and data life, which limits the ability to assess its full potential. Given these factors, a moderate price reflects the improvement while considering the uncertainty from the NULL traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product has a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates that it can provide some value in enhancing performance. The capacity is sufficient, indicating that the product can handle the necessary data workload. However, the medium data entropy and life suggest that while the data is useful, it may not be exceptionally high quality or longevity. The market score of 0.4 shows there's some demand, but not overwhelming. Overall, these traits suggest a fair value, but not a premium one.", 'confidence': 'medium'}

Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate value and potential performance improvement the data product can provide, while also accounting for the demand in the market. I am confident that this product can enhance performance effectively, making it worth this investment.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. While I recognize the potential performance improvement and moderate value of the data product, I believe that the uncertainties presented by the NULL traits warrant a more conservative investment. This price reflects my willingness to engage in this negotiation while aiming for a fair deal that considers both the product's capabilities and its limitations.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. This price reflects a balanced consideration of the product's moderate value while also addressing the uncertainties we previously discussed. I believe this is a fair midpoint that acknowledges both parties' perspectives.
