Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "While the market score indicates a modest level of demand (0.4), the lack of critical performance metrics (MPI, Data Entropy, Data Life, History) limits the product's potential value. However, the capacity being sufficient suggests that it can handle current demands, allowing for a baseline valuation.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The product has a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates a decent enhancement in model performance, suggesting it can provide value in a competitive market. The data life is long, meaning it remains relevant for an extended period, which is a positive trait. However, the low data entropy could imply limited variability or richness in the data, which may affect its appeal. The market score of 0.4 indicates a moderate level of demand, but the absence of historical data limits the confidence in the valuation. Overall, the combination of strengths and weaknesses positions the product in a mid-range price bracket.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
