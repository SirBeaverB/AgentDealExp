Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates some effectiveness in enhancing performance. The capacity is sufficient, and the market demand is relatively strong at 0.4, suggesting a decent potential for sales. However, the medium data entropy indicates that the data quality may be variable, and the NULL values for data life and history limit the confidence in long-term performance and reliability. Overall, while there's promise, the uncertainties reduce the valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a reasonable enhancement to existing models, which can attract buyers looking for improvements. The "enough" capacity suggests that it can handle current demand, while a medium data entropy indicates a balance of complexity and usability. However, the short data life limits long-term value, and the lack of historical data makes the valuation less precise. The market score of 0.4 reflects moderate interest and potential, but the presence of some NULL traits suggests caution in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the strong Model Performance Improvement of 0.3, which indicates a significant enhancement that can drive value for potential buyers. Additionally, the current demand capacity and balanced data entropy make this a compelling offer.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1500. While the Model Performance Improvement of 0.3 shows potential, the uncertainties regarding data quality and NULL values in critical areas limit the overall confidence in long-term value. Therefore, a price of 1500 reflects a fair valuation given the current context.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. The data quality concerns I previously mentioned have been addressed slightly, and I'm willing to negotiate considering the strong demand you highlighted. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1600. The seller's recent offer of 1700 shows a willingness to negotiate, but I believe that considering the ongoing data quality concerns and the uncertainties surrounding long-term value, a price of 1600 is fair and reasonable. Let's work towards a solid agreement that reflects both our interests.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1650. I believe this price fairly reflects the improvements in data quality and the ongoing demand while still addressing the concerns I have over long-term value. Let's keep the momentum going towards a solid agreement.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1600. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise given the ongoing demand and slight improvements in data quality while still keeping my concerns in mind. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement moving forward.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1600. I believe this price reflects the ongoing concerns regarding data quality while still acknowledging the improvements and demand in the market. It's a fair compromise that balances both our interests.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 1550. I believe this price strikes a balance between the seller's concerns regarding data quality and the improvements that have been made. It reflects my willingness to negotiate fairly while still acknowledging the positive trends in demand.
Round 5 (Seller): I offer 1575. I believe this price reflects a fair balance considering the improvements in data quality and ongoing demand while still acknowledging my concerns about long-term value. Let's find a satisfactory resolution.
Round 5 (Buyer): I offer 1560. I believe this price strikes a reasonable balance between the seller's offer and my previous positions, reflecting the improvements in data quality while still considering the seller¡¯s concerns. This price shows my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
