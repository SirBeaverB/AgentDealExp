Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a moderate enhancement in model effectiveness, which is a positive trait. However, the lack of information on data entropy, data life, history, and market limits the overall assessment of the product\'s value. Given the moderate MPI and the "enough" capacity, the expected price reflects a reasonable value while accounting for the uncertainty due to missing traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate model performance improvement (MPI of 0.3) which indicates potential effectiveness. The capacity being "enough" suggests it can handle current demands, and while the data entropy is high, indicating a complex dataset, the medium data life means it has some longevity. However, the market score of 0.5 reflects average demand, and the lack of historical data could limit its appeal. These factors combined suggest a reasonable price point.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2500. This price reflects the moderate model performance improvement and the data's potential effectiveness despite some complexities. Given the current market conditions, I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1200. Given the moderate model performance improvement and the uncertainties surrounding data entropy, life, and history, I believe this price is more aligned with the product's potential value. This allows room for negotiation while addressing the complexities mentioned.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. The data's potential is significant, and while I appreciate the buyer's previous offer, I believe this new price reflects a fairer balance between value and performance.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1600. The data's potential is indeed noteworthy, and while I recognize the seller's perspective, I believe this price reflects a more balanced evaluation of the current market conditions and the uncertainties surrounding the data's performance.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1650. This price reflects a reasonable compromise, taking into account the buyer's previous offer of 1600 while also acknowledging the inherent value and potential of the data product. I believe this amount is fair and aligns well with market expectations.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1600. I believe this price continues to reflect a fair assessment of the data product's value while addressing the concerns regarding performance and market conditions. It allows us to move forward in this negotiation without losing sight of the inherent worth of the offering.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1625. I believe this price reflects a slight increase while still considering the uncertainties and market conditions we have discussed. It represents a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the data product while remaining within a reasonable range.

Round 5 (Seller): I offer 1610. Given the previous discussions and the buyer's last offer of 1600, this price reflects a slight increase while still being reasonable and aligned with the value I believe the data product holds. I want to find a middle ground that acknowledges both parties' perspectives.
Round 5 (Buyer): I offer 1605. I believe this price reflects a fair approach, taking into account the seller's recent offer while still aligning with my valuation of the data product. It shows my willingness to negotiate while also acknowledging the potential value at stake. Let's work towards finalizing this deal.
