Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, low data entropy, and a long data life, which indicates it can provide stable and reliable insights over time. However, the absence of information on model performance improvement and market context limits the overall valuation. Given these strong traits, I estimate a moderate price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '8000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance performance, which is valuable in competitive markets. The capacity is sufficient, and low data entropy suggests the data is clean and reliable. A long data life adds to its durability and potential usefulness over time. However, the NULL history trait may indicate limited past performance data, slightly reducing confidence in the valuation. Overall, the favorable traits suggest a strong market potential and demand.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
