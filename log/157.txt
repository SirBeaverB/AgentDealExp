{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 0.3), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets where efficiency and accuracy are critical. However, the lack of data on capacity, entropy, life, history, and market diminishes the overall confidence in the product's value, suggesting that the price should be conservative.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can appeal to businesses looking for competitive advantages. However, the lack of data on capacity, data entropy, and the fact that the data life is short limits the product's long-term value. The market score of 0.4 suggests a modest demand. Therefore, while there is some value, the uncertainties lead to a conservative pricing estimate.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:2600.0
