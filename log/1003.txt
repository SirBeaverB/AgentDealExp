Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which is valuable for users looking to improve their models. The capacity is sufficient, and the data life being long suggests durability and ongoing relevance of the product. However, the absence of data entropy, history, and market information limits the ability to assess the full potential or market demand. Therefore, while there is value, the uncertainty due to missing traits tempers the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a good Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates it can significantly enhance existing models. Additionally, it has low data entropy and a long data life, suggesting reliable and sustainable data quality. The market demand is also moderate at 0.5. However, the lack of historical data limits the confidence in the valuation, but overall, the positive traits outweigh the negative.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
