Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has adequate capacity and medium data entropy, suggesting it can handle a reasonable amount of data with some complexity. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement and data life limits its potential value. The market score of 0.4 indicates a moderate level of demand, which supports a conservative price estimate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to potential buyers. The capacity being "enough" suggests that it can handle a decent amount of data, and the long data life implies that the product will remain useful for a significant period. However, the medium data entropy suggests that data quality may vary, and the market score of 0.4 indicates a moderate level of demand. Overall, these traits point towards a product that has value but is not at the top tier in the market.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1767.5

Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1700. While the seller emphasizes the product's value, my assessment considers the moderate market demand and the product's limitations in terms of model performance improvement and data life. This leads me to seek a more conservative price.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1750. This price reflects a balanced consideration of the data product's notable value and the current market demand while providing an attractive option for both parties to move forward in this negotiation.
