Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in the model's effectiveness, which can be valuable for businesses looking to optimize their data processes. However, the lack of additional data traits such as capacity, data entropy, data life, and market information limits the overall understanding of the product's potential value. Given these uncertainties, the price reflects a conservative estimate based on the available performance improvement metric.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a moderate enhancement in model effectiveness, which could appeal to businesses looking to improve their data-driven decisions. However, the absence of capacity, data entropy, and a short data life limits the product's long-term applicability and value. The market rating of 0.3 indicates a low demand, which further constrains the expected price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
