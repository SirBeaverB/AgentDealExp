Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate improvement, which can be attractive to potential users. The capacity being "enough" suggests it can handle the current demand, but the medium data entropy and short data life may limit its long-term applicability. However, the lack of market and history data creates uncertainty, leading to a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating some potential for enhancing performance. The market score of 0.4 suggests a reasonable level of demand, albeit not very high. However, the medium data entropy and short data life could limit the product's long-term utility, making it less valuable. The absence of historical data is a concern for buyers, but the capacity is adequate. Overall, the expected price reflects these mixed signals.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
