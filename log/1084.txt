Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 0.3), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance. While the market rating is moderate at 0.4, the product has sufficient capacity and a medium data life, suggesting it can be deployed effectively. However, the absence of data entropy and history limits the assessment of long-term reliability and potential value. Therefore, the price reflects a balance between the existing traits and the uncertainty from the NULL values.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a significant enhancement over baseline models, which is attractive to potential buyers. The market score of 0.4 suggests a moderate demand, and although the history is NULL, the existing traits imply a medium level of data quality and capacity. This combination leads to a reasonable valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
