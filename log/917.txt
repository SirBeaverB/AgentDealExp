Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has low data entropy, indicating high quality and reliability of the data. Additionally, the capacity is adequate, suggesting it can handle necessary data loads. However, the absence of information on model performance improvement and other traits limits confidence in the overall valuation, hence the price reflects a moderate value based on available strengths.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests that the product can enhance performance moderately, which is a positive indicator. The capacity being sufficient and low data entropy means the data is reliable and easy to work with, making it appealing for potential buyers. However, the medium data life suggests it may not have long-term sustainability, which could affect its value. The market score of 0.3 indicates a niche demand, but not a strong one. Given these factors, a price of 2000 is reasonable.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
