Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it can provide some value over existing solutions. The 'long' Data Life suggests that it will remain relevant for an extended period, which is beneficial for potential buyers. However, the NULL values for Data Entropy and History limit the understanding of the data quality and previous performance, which could affect the price. The market rating of 0.3 indicates a reasonable demand, but not overwhelming. Overall, the combination of traits suggests a mid-range price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a decent Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating it can enhance existing models. The capacity is adequate, and low data entropy suggests the data is consistent and reliable. The long data life adds value as the data remains relevant for an extended period. However, the NULL history limits insights into past performance or stability. The market score of 0.3 suggests a modest demand, which also influences the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:No deal.
Dealing Process:
