Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate level of enhancement that could appeal to users looking for efficiency gains. The market score of 0.5 suggests there is some demand, but the presence of NULL traits, especially for Data Entropy, Data Life, and History, indicates significant gaps in information that could affect the product's overall perceived value. Therefore, while there's potential for value, the uncertainty reduces confidence.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model shows a performance improvement of 0.25, indicating it has some efficacy and could provide value in its application. The capacity is sufficient for usage, and the medium data entropy suggests manageable complexity. However, the short data life and NULL history may limit its long-term applicability and reliability. The market demand of 0.5 indicates moderate interest, but the combination of traits suggests a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400.
