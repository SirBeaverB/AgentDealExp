Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'While many traits are NULL, the capacity being described as "enough" suggests that the product has potential usability. However, the uncertainty due to lacking critical performance metrics and market data limits its value. The expected price reflects a cautious valuation based on available capacity and potential interest.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement to the existing system, which can be valuable in a competitive market environment. However, the data life being short may limit its long-term usability, and the low data entropy suggests that the data is not very diverse, which could impact its overall value. The market score of 0.4 indicates a moderate demand. Given these factors, the expected price reflects both potential and limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1675.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in model performance indicated by the MPI of 0.2, which can provide significant value in a competitive market. The demand score of 0.4 suggests there is interest in this data, and I believe this price captures the potential while accounting for the limitations of short data life and low diversity.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. The seller's price of 1800 seems high given the limitations of short data life and low diversity. My offer reflects a cautious approach, considering the potential usability but also the uncertainty surrounding the data's performance metrics.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. I believe this price fairly reflects the moderate performance enhancement and demand for the data while also taking into account its limited lifespan and diversity. This offer strikes a balance that could benefit both parties.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price acknowledges the seller's assessment while also considering the data's limited lifespan and diversity. This offer reflects a fair compromise that takes into account both parties' perspectives and aims for a beneficial outcome.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1680. This price reflects a balanced view of the data's moderate performance enhancement and its limited lifespan, while still acknowledging the buyer's interest. It represents a fair middle ground between our previous offers, and I believe it's a reasonable step towards closing the deal.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1670. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the data's current value, taking into account its moderate performance enhancement and limited lifespan. It shows my willingness to negotiate while still considering the seller's perspective.
