{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'high'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "While the model performance improvement is not available, the product has enough capacity and high data entropy, which suggests it can handle complex and varied datasets. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, which can support a reasonable price point. However, the lack of data life and history limits confidence in the product's long-term value.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate model performance improvement (0.2) which indicates some level of effectiveness. However, the data has a high entropy and short life, suggesting it may not be reliable for long-term use or analysis. The market factor of 0.5 indicates a moderate demand, but the lack of historical data limits the confidence in its overall performance in real-world applications. Given these factors, a price of 1500 reflects its potential value while accounting for the uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate model performance improvement of the data product and the potential value it can bring, despite its high entropy and short life. I believe this price represents a fair balance between the product's effectiveness and the uncertainties surrounding its reliability.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400. The product does have high data entropy and capacity, but the lack of proven model performance improvement and the uncertainties regarding its long-term value warrant a more cautious approach. My offer reflects a fair assessment considering these factors.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1500. I believe this price strikes a balance between the moderate performance improvements and the uncertainties we've discussed. It reflects the potential value while remaining cautious about the data's proven effectiveness.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1450. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, acknowledging the seller's concerns about the data's uncertainties while still recognizing the potential value it brings. This offer demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1500. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between the potential value of the data and the concerns regarding its effectiveness. It acknowledges the improvements discussed while still being cautious about the uncertainties involved.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1480. I believe this price acknowledges the seller's concerns while still reflecting a fair value for the data, considering the improvements and potential it holds. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while remaining cautious about the uncertainties involved.
