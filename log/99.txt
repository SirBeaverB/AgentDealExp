Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and sufficient capacity, which indicates it can be used effectively over an extended period. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data entropy, and market demand limits the valuation. Therefore, while the product has potential value, the uncertainty surrounding the NULL traits keeps the price moderate.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product exhibits a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates a moderate enhancement in performance. The capacity is sufficient, and the data entropy is low, suggesting that the data is organized and reliable. Additionally, the long data life implies sustained value over time. However, the market score of 0.3 indicates limited demand, which tempers the expected price. Given these factors, a price of 1500 seems reasonable.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Thus, my offer reflects a cautious approach to this deal.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1750. I believe this price reflects the strong performance improvement and reliability of my data product while also addressing the buyer's concerns about market demand. This adjusted price should encourage a more favorable negotiation while still valuing the high quality of what I provide.
