Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in a competitive market. However, the lack of information on capacity, data entropy, data life, and history suggests uncertainty in the overall quality and applicability of the product. The market factor of 0.5 indicates a reasonable demand, but the absence of key traits limits the potential valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in applications where model accuracy is crucial. However, the NULL values for capacity and data entropy imply a lack of critical information, which diminishes the overall value assessment. The medium data life suggests the product has a reasonable operational lifespan, while a market value of 0.5 indicates moderate demand. Given these factors, a conservative estimate of 3000 reflects potential value while acknowledging significant uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:3550.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 4000. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in model performance indicated by the MPI of 0.2, which is valuable in applications prioritizing accuracy. Given the potential of this data product, I believe it warrants a premium valuation despite the uncertainties surrounding capacity and data entropy.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 2000. This price reflects my concerns about the uncertainties surrounding the product's capacity, data entropy, and history, which limit its overall valuation despite the moderate MPI of 0.2. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 3500. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the valuations presented, taking into account the moderate MPI of 0.2 for accuracy potential while still addressing the concerns regarding capacity and data entropy. This way, we can move forward in a mutually beneficial manner.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 3600. I believe this price strikes a balance that acknowledges the moderate MPI of 0.2 for accuracy potential while also remaining mindful of the concerns regarding capacity and data entropy. This adjustment reflects my commitment to finding a mutually acceptable solution as we move forward in this negotiation.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 3550. This price reflects a balanced consideration of the moderate MPI of 0.2, while addressing the concerns about capacity and data entropy. It represents a fair compromise between the previous offers and allows us to move forward in this negotiation effectively.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 3550. This price is a fair reflection of the moderate MPI of 0.2, while also addressing the concerns regarding capacity and data entropy. It provides a balanced opportunity for both parties to move forward effectively in this negotiation.
