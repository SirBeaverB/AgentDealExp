Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a decent enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable for users looking to improve their data-driven outcomes. However, the lack of additional information such as data entropy, data life, and market factors limits confidence in the valuation. Given the decent MPI but insufficient context, the expected price is moderate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a notable enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to users. The capacity is sufficient, and the data life is long, suggesting sustainability and reliability. However, the medium data entropy and the market rating of 0.5 indicate moderate market demand. The lack of historical data may dampen confidence in the product's track record. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a reasonable pricing estimate.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
