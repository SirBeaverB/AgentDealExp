Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 0.3), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle the required workload. However, the other traits being NULL limits the overall confidence in the product\'s value, as we lack information about data entropy, history, and market context. Despite the gaps, a medium data life suggests that the product has a reasonable longevity, which supports a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement is positive at 0.3, indicating a decent enhancement in performance. However, the high data entropy suggests complexity which may deter some users. The medium data life reflects that the product has a limited lifespan but is currently functional. Additionally, the market score of 0.3 indicates a low demand, which may further depress the price. Overall, these factors suggest a cautiously optimistic valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the significant potential of the data product to enhance model performance, despite its complexity and medium demand in the market. I believe this valuation captures the value while allowing room for negotiation.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400. Given the moderate enhancement in performance indicated by the MPI of 0.3, and considering the gaps in critical information about data entropy and history, I believe this price reflects a fair starting point for negotiation. I'm eager to find common ground and reach a deal that benefits both parties.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. This price reflects the high quality and significant potential of the data product to enhance model performance, while also considering the buyer's previous offer for a more collaborative negotiation approach.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1600. This price acknowledges the seller's emphasis on the quality and potential of the data product while also reflecting the need for a more reasonable compromise based on my previous concerns about its performance enhancement capabilities.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1650. This price reflects the high quality and potential of the data product while considering the buyer's previous offer of 1600. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while being reasonable for the buyer's perspective.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1600. I believe this price continues to reflect a reasonable assessment of the data product's quality while addressing my concerns regarding its performance enhancements. I'm looking for a fair compromise that acknowledges both the value of the product and the budget constraints I have.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1650. This price reflects the high quality of the data product and its significant potential to enhance model performance, while still being reasonable and considering the buyer's last offer.
