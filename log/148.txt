Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': "The product has a short data life and a low market rating of 0.3, which suggests limited demand and utility. The absence of critical traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, and Data Entropy reduces the product's overall value and reliability. Therefore, the expected price reflects these challenges.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing to users looking for efficiency gains. However, the short data life and the presence of NULL traits suggest limitations in long-term value and usability. Given the market rating of 0.3, it reflects a moderate demand but with significant uncertainty due to the lack of comprehensive trait data.', 'confidence': 'low'}
