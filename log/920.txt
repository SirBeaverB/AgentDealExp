Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life and low data entropy, which indicates that the data is likely to be reliable and stable over time. However, the market size is low (0.3) and there are several NULL traits, which limits the overall valuation. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a moderate valuation based on the available traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing in certain markets. The capacity being "enough" indicates that the product can handle expected demand, while low data entropy suggests that the data is well-structured and reliable. However, the medium data life and lack of historical data may limit the perceived long-term value. Given these factors, a price of 5000 reflects a balanced view of potential benefits versus limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
