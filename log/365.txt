Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating it can enhance existing models' performance. However, the high data entropy suggests that the data may be complex or diverse, which can be valuable for certain applications. The lack of information on data life, history, and market limits the overall valuation, but the potential for performance improvement can still attract interest.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance, which is appealing for users looking for better results. The capacity is sufficient to handle demand, and although the data entropy is high, it can signify a diverse dataset that might lead to better insights. However, the medium data life and lack of historical data do raise some concerns about longevity and reliability. The market rating of 0.4 suggests a moderate level of demand, indicating a potential niche market. Overall, the product has strengths that can justify a price in the lower end of the mid-range, considering these factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
