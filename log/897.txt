Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product has sufficient capacity, indicating it can handle a reasonable amount of data or workloads. However, due to the absence of critical traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market, the overall value is limited. The expected price reflects a basic valuation based on existing capacity, but the lack of comprehensive data reduces confidence in the product's overall effectiveness and market competitiveness.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement, which can be appealing in certain markets, especially if the capacity is deemed sufficient. However, the low data entropy suggests that the data is relatively predictable and may not provide significant insights. The short data life limits its long-term usability, but the market score of 0.5 suggests there is some demand which can help maintain value. Overall, while there are strengths, the limitations in data life and the lack of historical data reduce the overall valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 3500. This price reflects the moderate enhancement indicated by the Model Performance Improvement and acknowledges the current market demand, despite the limitations in data life and predictability.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 3400. This price is a reflection of the product's current limitations and the absence of critical traits that would enhance its overall value, while still acknowledging the seller's moderate enhancements.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 3450. This price reflects the value of the product while considering the enhancements mentioned by the buyer, but also acknowledges the limitations that I highlighted previously. I believe this is a fair compromise that meets the current market demand.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 3400. This price takes into account the enhancements discussed while remaining aligned with the product's limitations. I believe this is a reasonable offer that reflects both my interest and the current market conditions.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 3425. I believe this price reflects the current market demand while also considering the limitations of the product. It's a fair compromise that acknowledges both the enhancements and the critical traits that may not meet all expectations.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 3400. I believe this price demonstrates my serious interest in the product and reflects the ongoing market dynamics. While the seller's offer is close, I am confident that my offer strikes a balance between value and the product's limitations. Let's find a solution that works for both parties.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 3410. I believe this price reflects a reasonable adjustment considering the buyer's interest and the current market dynamics, while still accounting for the product's limitations. Let's find a middle ground.
