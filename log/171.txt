Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate level of enhancement in performance. However, the short data life suggests that the product may not provide long-term value, which could limit its market appeal. Despite the lack of additional information on history, market, and data entropy, the existing capacity is sufficient. Thus, the expected price reflects a balance between moderate performance and the potential limitations due to data life.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 suggests a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. The capacity is deemed "enough," indicating that the product can handle a reasonable amount of data, while the medium data entropy suggests a balanced complexity. However, the short data life implies that the product may not have long-lasting value, impacting its overall price. The market score of 0.4 indicates there is some demand, but it is not particularly strong. Overall, these factors suggest a moderate value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
