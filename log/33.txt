Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': "The absence of key traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, and others indicates a lack of information about the product's effectiveness and utility. This uncertainty significantly lowers the perceived value.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. The market score of 0.4 suggests there is some demand, but the presence of NULL traits, particularly for capacity and data entropy, limits the overall confidence in the product's potential. Given the medium data life, the product might still have some longevity, allowing it to command a reasonable price despite uncertainties.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:2100.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2500. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in performance indicated by the Model Performance Improvement of 0.2, which is valuable in competitive markets. The potential of this data product, despite some limitations, justifies a higher asking price.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 300. The significant uncertainty surrounding the product's effectiveness and utility, given the lack of key traits, leads me to a much lower valuation.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 2000. This price reflects a balance between the potential of the product and the concerns regarding its limitations. It¡¯s an attractive offer considering the moderate performance improvement it provides, while still addressing the uncertainty expressed by the lower offer. Let's move forward with a fair deal.
