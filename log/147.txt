Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity, which indicates that it can handle a reasonable amount of data processing or storage. However, the short data life suggests that it may not provide long-term value. The absence of information on model performance and other traits limits the assessment, but the existing capacity could justify a moderate price.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 suggests that the product has the potential to enhance model performance, which is valuable in data-driven industries. The "enough" capacity indicates that it can handle a reasonable amount of data, which is beneficial for users. However, the medium data entropy and short data life could limit its long-term applicability and value. The market score of 0.3 indicates a low demand, which affects pricing negatively. Overall, while there are some positive traits, the limitations and market conditions suggest a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
