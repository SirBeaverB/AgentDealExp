{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': "The product has a short data life, which limits its long-term value and usability. Additionally, with multiple traits being NULL, it creates uncertainty around the product's performance and applicability. Therefore, the expected price is low.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a moderate level of enhancement provided by the product. However, the short data life and the presence of several NULL traits imply limitations in reliability and scope. The market demand of 0.3 indicates some interest but not overwhelming potential. Therefore, while there is some value due to performance improvement, the overall uncertainty reduces the expected price.', 'confidence': 'low'}
