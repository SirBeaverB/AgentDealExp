Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and a moderate market demand (0.5), but high data entropy and short data life suggest that the data may not be suitable for long-term use or stable insights. The lack of information in Model Performance Improvement and History adds uncertainty. Therefore, the price reflects a balance between potential value and inherent risks.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests that the product can enhance performance reasonably, but the high data entropy indicates that the data is complex and potentially difficult to work with. The "enough" capacity is a positive trait, but the short data life suggests that the product may not have long-term viability, which could limit its overall value. The market score of 0.5 signals that there is moderate demand, but the lack of historical data makes it hard to ascertain its past performance. Overall, the expected price reflects the balance of these factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
