Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The data product has enough capacity and a long data life, which indicates it can store and maintain valuable information for an extended period. However, high data entropy suggests that the data may be complex or less structured, which could hinder its immediate usability. The lack of information regarding model performance improvement and market potential introduces uncertainty, but the other traits suggest a reasonable baseline value for the product.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.25 indicates a significant enhancement in the product's effectiveness, which can attract users looking for better performance. The capacity being sufficient suggests that it can handle current demands. However, the high data entropy may indicate complexity, which could either be a drawback or an opportunity for sophisticated applications. The long data life suggests that this product can be relevant and useful over time, appealing to customers looking for longevity. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, which balances the overall valuation.", 'confidence': 'high'}
