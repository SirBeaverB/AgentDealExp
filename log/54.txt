Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'low'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and low data entropy, which indicates a stable and reliable dataset. However, the presence of NULL traits suggests limited information about model performance and data life, which affects overall confidence. The market score of 0.3 indicates a low demand, keeping the price conservative.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model's performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing for users looking to improve their existing systems. The capacity is sufficient, and low data entropy suggests that the data is well-organized and reliable. However, the market score of 0.3 reflects a relatively low demand or competition, which tempers the overall valuation. The medium data life indicates that the product has a decent longevity but is not cutting-edge. Overall, these factors lead to a reasonable price estimate.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1670.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in performance indicated by the model's performance improvement, as well as the well-organized and reliable nature of the data. While the market score shows low competition, the product's decent longevity adds value. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. While I appreciate the seller's perspective on the data's performance and organization, I believe my offer reflects the current market conditions and the low demand indicated by the market score. I am confident that this price is reasonable for a dataset with some limitations in information. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. This price reflects the value of the dataset while considering the current market conditions and the improvements in performance and reliability that have been highlighted. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges both parties' positions.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price strikes a balance between the value of the dataset and the current market conditions, acknowledging the improvements mentioned while also considering my previous offer. It¡¯s a reasonable step towards reaching an agreement.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1680. The dataset has shown improvements, and I believe this price reflects its current value while considering market conditions.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1660. I believe this price strikes a fair balance between the dataset's improved performance and the current market conditions.
