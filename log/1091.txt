Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life and sufficient capacity, indicating it can provide value over a reasonable period and handle a decent amount of data. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data entropy, history, and market limits the assessment of its full potential. Thus, the price reflects a cautious estimate based on the available traits.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.3 indicates a decent enhancement capability, which is valuable in the market. The market rating of 0.5 suggests a moderate demand, and while the data entropy and life being medium imply some limitations, the overall capacity being "enough" contributes positively. However, the lack of historical data does lower the confidence in long-term performance.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
