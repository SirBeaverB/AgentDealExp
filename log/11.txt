Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '100', 'reason': 'The product has a short data life, which significantly limits its long-term value and usefulness. Additionally, the lack of available traits (NULL values) indicates uncertainty regarding its performance and applicability, making it difficult to justify a higher price.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 suggests a moderate enhancement in model performance, which could be appealing to certain users. However, the short data life and the lack of information on capacity and data entropy limit the product's long-term value. The market score of 0.4 indicates a modest demand but not strong enough to support a higher price. Given these factors, a moderate price is justified.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:No deal.
