Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and low data entropy, suggesting it can handle a reasonable amount of data efficiently and provide reliable insights. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data life, history, and market limits the potential value. The expected price reflects a cautious optimism based on the available traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance performance meaningfully. The capacity is sufficient, and low data entropy suggests the data is structured and reliable. However, the short data life may impact long-term value. The market score of 0.4 suggests there is some demand, but it is relatively limited. Overall, these factors indicate a reasonable value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
