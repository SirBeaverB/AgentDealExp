Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and sufficient capacity, indicating it can be useful over time and handle a reasonable amount of data. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, and History limits the assessment of its effectiveness and market fit. Therefore, the price reflects a moderate valuation considering its potential utility despite the uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates it can enhance the effectiveness of existing models. The low data entropy suggests that the data is stable and reliable, which is appealing for data-driven decision-making. The long data life adds value as the product can provide insights over an extended period. However, the market demand is also at 0.3, indicating limited interest. The lack of historical data makes it difficult to ascertain the product's past performance, which affects confidence. Therefore, while it has potential, the overall valuation remains moderate.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
