{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a decent improvement in performance, suggesting that the product can yield better results than some existing solutions. However, the lack of additional information regarding capacity, data entropy, data life, history, and market limits the confidence in this valuation. As a result, the price is set at a moderate level to reflect potential value while accounting for uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a decent enhancement in model performance, which could attract interest in certain markets. However, the NULL values for capacity and data entropy, along with limited historical data, limit the confidence in the product's overall capabilities. The medium data life suggests it can remain relevant for some time, but uncertainty due to missing traits lowers its valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:2900.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2500. This price reflects the promising Model Performance Improvement of 0.25, which indicates a significant enhancement potential for various applications, despite some limitations in data quality. I believe this value captures the product's unique capabilities and relevance in the market.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 3000. This price reflects the potential of the product, considering the Model Performance Improvement of 0.25, while also accounting for the uncertainties in data quality. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
