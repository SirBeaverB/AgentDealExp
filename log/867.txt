Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which indicates it can handle the expected workload. However, the short data life suggests limited usability over time, and the lack of information on model performance, data entropy, and history raises concerns about its overall effectiveness and reliability. This leads to a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model effectiveness, which could attract interest. However, the low data entropy suggests the data is not very complex, and the short data life might limit its long-term applicability. The market score of 0.3 is also relatively low, indicating limited demand. Overall, while there is some value due to the performance improvement, the limitations weigh heavily on the product's overall potential.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
