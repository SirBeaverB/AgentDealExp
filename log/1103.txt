Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 0.3), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a significant enhancement in model performance, which is valuable in data-driven industries. The capacity being "enough" suggests that it can handle the required workload, and the medium data entropy and life indicate a balanced and sustainable data product. However, the lack of historical and market data introduces some uncertainty, which limits the valuation. Nevertheless, the performance improvement can justify a reasonable price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.3 indicates a reasonable enhancement in predictive capabilities, which is valuable in many data-driven markets. The capacity being sufficient suggests that the product can handle the necessary workloads, while medium data entropy and medium data life indicate a balanced trade-off between complexity and longevity. The market score of 0.5 suggests a moderate demand; thus, the pricing reflects potential value without being overly optimistic due to the lack of historical data.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 3000. This price reflects the significant enhancement in predictive capabilities and the balanced trade-off presented by the data product, ensuring its value in data-driven markets.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 2900. While I appreciate the seller's offer of 3000, I believe that given the uncertainties regarding historical and market data, a slightly lower price is more reflective of the current valuation. This adjustment accounts for the risks involved while still recognizing the substantial enhancement in predictive capabilities offered by the data product.
