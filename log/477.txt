{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'low'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 and has enough capacity, indicating it can handle significant data loads efficiently. However, the low data entropy suggests that the data is relatively uniform and may not provide high variability for complex analyses. The absence of information regarding data life, history, and market limits the confidence in the product's potential value. Hence, the valuation is conservative.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a moderate model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates it can add some value to existing systems. However, the low data entropy suggests that the data is quite predictable and may not provide significant new insights. The short data life indicates that the product may have limited long-term utility. The market score of 0.5 suggests a moderate demand, but the lack of historical data limits confidence in its effectiveness. Overall, these factors lead to a conservative valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
