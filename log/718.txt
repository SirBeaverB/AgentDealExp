Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating some beneficial enhancement for users. The capacity is sufficient, and the market demand is at a reasonable level of 0.5, suggesting a fair interest in the product. However, the medium data entropy indicates some complexity in the data, which could affect usability. The NULL values for Data Life and History reduce the confidence in long-term value and reliability. Overall, the combination of traits suggests a moderate market potential, justifying the expected price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate improvement in model performance (MPI of 0.25), which can appeal to users looking for efficiency gains. The long data life indicates that the product is likely to remain relevant for an extended period. Additionally, a medium level of data entropy suggests that the data isn¡¯t overly complex, making it easier to analyze and interpret. However, the lack of historical data limits the confidence in the product¡¯s long-term effectiveness. The market value of 0.5 indicates a moderate demand, suggesting a reasonable price point.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate improvement in model performance and the long data life, which enhances its value in the market. The product's efficiency gains can significantly benefit users, making it a competitive offering.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1700. The offered price of 1800 is close to my valuation, but considering the medium data entropy and the NULL values for Data Life and History, I believe 1700 is a more reasonable starting point that reflects the product's moderate market potential.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1750. This price reflects a balance between the value of the improved performance and long data life I provide, while acknowledging the concerns about medium data entropy and NULL values raised by you.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1725. This price strikes a reasonable compromise, acknowledging the seller's improvements while still factoring in the concerns about medium data entropy and NULL values that I've raised. It's a fair step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1775. This price reflects the balance between the improved performance and long data life of the product while still addressing the buyer's concerns about medium data entropy and NULL values. I believe this is a fair valuation that recognizes the quality of the product.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1750. This price takes into account the seller's improvements in performance and longevity while still being mindful of the medium data entropy and NULL values that we discussed. It's a balanced approach that reflects the quality of the product without exceeding my budget.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1760. This price reflects the high quality and performance of the product while taking into account the buyer's previous offer of 1750. I believe this is a fair and reasonable adjustment that acknowledges both the value of the product and the buyer's budget considerations.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 1755. This price reflects my acknowledgment of the seller's quality claims while still addressing my budget constraints. It's a reasonable compromise that values the improvements made without exceeding my limits.
