Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The absence of key traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market indicates a lack of information on the product's value and utility. However, there may still be a baseline value due to potential interest in the product, hence a conservative estimate.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be appealing to potential buyers. However, the short data life and lack of available information on capacity, data entropy, and history limit the product's overall value. The market demand is relatively low at 0.3, which also constrains the price. Therefore, the expected price reflects a balance between potential utility and the uncertainties presented by the available data traits.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
