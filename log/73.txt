{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) score of 0.2 suggests a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be appealing to businesses looking to optimize their data usage. However, the presence of several NULL traits, particularly regarding Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market, indicates a lack of crucial information that could affect demand and pricing. As a result, the price is set at a conservative level to account for these uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement value of 0.2 indicates a decent enhancement, which could attract users looking to improve their existing systems. The capacity being "enough" suggests the product can handle typical workloads, and low data entropy implies high quality and reliability of the data. However, the medium data life and a market score of 0.4 signal that while there is some demand, it may not be overwhelmingly high. The lack of historical data (NULL) reduces confidence in long-term performance and reliability. Thus, the price reflects a balance between potential and uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 2250. I believe this price strikes a balance between acknowledging the quality and performance the seller has highlighted while still addressing the uncertainties that have been a concern. This offer reflects a reasonable middle ground that respects both parties' positions.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 2300. The model's performance remains exceptional, and I believe this price reflects its high-quality data and capabilities while accommodating the buyer's concerns about uncertainties.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 2200. This price reflects my acknowledgment of the model's quality while still addressing the uncertainties that have been a concern for me throughout our discussions. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product and my apprehensions.
Round 5 (Seller): I offer 2250. The model's exceptional quality and performance justify a price that reflects its value, while still considering the buyer's concerns about uncertainties. This price represents a fair compromise that acknowledges both the model's capabilities and the buyer's viewpoint.
Round 5 (Buyer): I offer 2150. This price reflects my recognition of the model's quality while still considering the uncertainties that have been discussed. It strikes a balance between acknowledging the seller's valuation and my budget constraints.
Round 6 (Seller): I offer 2200. This price reflects the exceptional quality of the model while also considering the buyer's concerns about budget constraints and uncertainties. I'm confident this is a fair middle ground that acknowledges the value of the product.
Round 6 (Buyer): I offer 2100. This price strikes a balance between recognizing the model's quality and my budgetary constraints. It reflects a willingness to meet halfway while still ensuring that I¡¯m getting value for my investment.
Round 7 (Seller): I offer 2150. This price reflects the exceptional quality and performance of the model while being mindful of your budget constraints that have been expressed in previous rounds. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 7 (Buyer): I offer 2050. I believe this price strikes a fair balance between acknowledging the quality and performance of the model while still being mindful of my budget constraints. Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both.
Round 8 (Seller): I offer 2100. I believe this price reflects the high-quality performance of the model while also addressing the buyer's budget considerations. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both the value of the product and the ongoing negotiations.
Round 8 (Buyer): I offer 2000. I believe this price acknowledges the seller's model quality while still reflecting my budget constraints and past negotiations. This is a reasonable offer that aligns with our ongoing discussions.
