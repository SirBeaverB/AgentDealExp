Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable for businesses looking to optimize their data-driven decisions. While the capacity is marked as "enough," and the data life is medium, the lack of information on data entropy, history, and market reduces overall confidence. However, the MPI suggests that the product can provide a meaningful impact, justifying a reasonable price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in functionality, which is valuable in the market. The medium data entropy and medium data life suggest that the data is relatively reliable and useful. However, the lack of historical data may limit the product's appeal to some buyers. The market size of 0.4 indicates a moderate demand, supporting a reasonable price point. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a conservative valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
