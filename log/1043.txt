Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity, indicating it can handle a reasonable amount of data processing or storage needs. However, the short data life may limit its long-term value, and the absence of several key traits makes it difficult to assess its overall quality and performance. Therefore, the expected price reflects a moderate valuation considering the potential utility but acknowledges the uncertainty due to the missing information.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can attract users looking to optimize processes. The medium data entropy suggests that the data is somewhat complex but manageable, and the market score of 0.5 indicates a reasonable level of demand. However, the short data life and lack of historical data may limit long-term value and applicability, leading to a moderate pricing.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
