{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate improvement, which can be beneficial for potential users. However, the absence of critical traits such as Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market significantly limits the overall value and applicability of the product. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a cautious valuation based on the limited information available.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.2 indicates a promising increase in efficiency or effectiveness, which can be appealing to potential users. The capacity being sufficient suggests it can handle the necessary data loads, while medium data entropy and life imply a balanced level of complexity and longevity. However, the single NULL in the history trait suggests limited historical validation, which could affect confidence in long-term performance. The market value of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, supporting a reasonable price point.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the significant model performance improvement of 0.2, indicating a strong potential for increased efficiency and effectiveness, which is very appealing in the current market. The capacity to handle necessary data loads, combined with balanced data entropy and longevity, supports this higher valuation.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400. Given the limitations in critical traits such as Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market, I believe this price reflects a more cautious valuation of the data product despite its moderate improvement in model performance.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1600.0. This price reflects the significant improvement in model performance and potential that we both recognize, while still considering the limitations that have been discussed. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer that acknowledges the value of the data product.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1500. This price reflects my continued interest in the data product while recognizing the seller¡¯s valid points about limitations. I believe this is a competitive offer that balances our positions and maintains the potential for a fruitful deal.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1550. This price reflects a balanced consideration of the model's improved performance while acknowledging the limitations that still exist. I'm looking to move closer to a fair agreement that recognizes both our positions.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1500. I believe this price accurately reflects the value considering the current market dynamics and the ongoing limitations of the model. It also shows my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement as we progress in our negotiations.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1550. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between the model's improved performance and its limitations, while also considering the strong market interest that has been expressed. Let's find a resolution that works for both of us.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 1500. I believe this price acknowledges the seller's perspective while still reflecting the value I see in the model's performance improvements. This allows us to stay competitive and find common ground in our negotiations. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 5 (Seller): I offer 1500. I believe this price strikes a fair balance considering the model's performance and market potential while still reflecting my position. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 5 (Buyer): I offer 1550. I believe this price better reflects the improvements in the model's performance while still acknowledging the limitations we've discussed. It positions us closer to a fair agreement and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal.
Round 6 (Seller): I offer 1550. I believe this price reflects the improvements in model performance while remaining competitive in the current market. It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the buyer's interest while also valuing the enhancements made.
Round 6 (Buyer): I offer 1500. I believe this price represents a fair compromise that reflects both the improvements in model performance and the need to remain competitive in the market. It acknowledges the seller's perspective while still aligning with my budget considerations.
Round 7 (Seller): I offer 1550. I believe this price reflects the improvements in model performance while also acknowledging the buyer's budget constraints, making it a fair and competitive offer for both parties.
Round 7 (Buyer): I offer 1500. I believe this price reflects a balanced approach that considers both the improvements in model performance and my budgetary constraints. It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value while ensuring we remain aligned in our negotiations.
Round 8 (Seller): I offer 1500. I believe this reflects a reasonable compromise given the ongoing discussions about model performance improvements and market potential, while also considering both parties' budget constraints.
Round 8 (Buyer): I offer 1450. I believe this price acknowledges the ongoing improvements in model performance while also considering the budget constraints we've discussed. It represents a fair compromise and keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
