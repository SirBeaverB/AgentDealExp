Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('small', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': ([2500, 3300, 3100, 8100, 2900], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has a short data life and a market value of 0.3, indicating limited demand and utility. However, the presence of some traits allows for a basic valuation. An expected price of 2000 reflects a cautious approach given the uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a low market value of 0.3 and low data entropy, which indicates that it may not be in high demand or have significant diversity in its data. The model performance improvement of 0.2 suggests some enhancement, but given the small capacity and short data life, its practical application may be limited. Additionally, the historical values show some fluctuation but do not indicate strong growth or stability.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1750.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the potential value of the data product, considering its unique features and the slight enhancements it provides. While the market may indicate some limitations, I believe there is room for negotiation that can lead to a beneficial deal for both parties.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1700. This price takes into account the short lifespan of the data product and its limited market demand. While I recognize its unique features, the overall utility remains questionable, and I believe this offer is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1750. This price reflects the unique features of the data product while also considering the concerns about its market demand. I believe this is a fair midpoint that acknowledges its value and potential without undervaluing it.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1750. This price balances the unique features and potential of the data product while addressing the concerns regarding its limited market demand. It's a reasonable compromise that recognizes its value without overshooting.
