Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a positive impact on performance, which can be valuable to users seeking enhancements in their models. However, the short data life and several NULL traits limit the product's overall appeal and reliability. The expected price reflects the potential benefit but is moderated by the uncertainties associated with the missing data and short-term usability.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. However, the short data life and the presence of multiple NULL traits limit the overall value. The market score of 0.3 suggests some demand but not substantial. Therefore, the expected price reflects a balance between potential utility and the limitations present.', 'confidence': 'low'}
