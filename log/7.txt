{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a notable enhancement in performance, which can be valuable for users seeking to optimize their models. However, the lack of information on capacity, data entropy, and market limits the overall confidence in the valuation. Given the short data life, potential buyers may also be wary, but the MPI suggests a reasonable price point for a temporary boost in performance.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable to users looking to optimize their models. However, the short data life and NULL values for capacity, data entropy, and history limit the product's long-term viability and usability. Additionally, a market score of 0.3 suggests a relatively low demand, which further restricts the potential price. Therefore, while the product has some value, it is constrained by these factors.", 'confidence': 'low'}
