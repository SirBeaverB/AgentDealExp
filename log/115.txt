{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life, suggesting it can provide value over a reasonable period, but the absence of other key traits such as Model Performance Improvement and Capacity limits its overall market competitiveness and potential. Given these factors, the price reflects a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive in the market. The medium data life suggests the product can still be useful for a reasonable period. The market score of 0.5 implies there is some demand, but the NULL traits introduce uncertainty. Therefore, while there is potential value, it is tempered by the lack of complete data.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
