Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and sufficient capacity, indicating it can be utilized effectively over time. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy, as well as a moderately low market score, suggests limited competitive advantage and demand. This results in a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a noticeable enhancement in performance, which is a valuable trait in data products. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle a reasonable amount of data, and the long data life indicates that the product can be used effectively over time. However, the medium data entropy could imply some complexity in data interpretation. The market rating of 0.5 shows moderate demand, which gives some support to the valuation, but the lack of historical data leaves some uncertainty. Overall, considering these aspects, a price of 1500 is reasonable.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
