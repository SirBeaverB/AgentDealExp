Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable for users looking to improve their models. However, the short data life and the absence of additional traits (like data entropy, history, and market information) significantly limit the product\'s potential. The "enough" capacity suggests it can handle current needs, but without more context, the overall value remains modest.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be beneficial for users. However, the high data entropy suggests that the data may be complex and less predictable, while the short data life indicates that the data may not be sustainable for long-term use. The market score of 0.5 reflects a reasonable demand, but the lack of historical data limits confidence in the product's long-term viability. Overall, the product has potential value but comes with significant risks due to its short data life and high entropy.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
