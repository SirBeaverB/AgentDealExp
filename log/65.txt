Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable for users seeking to optimize their data processes. The data life being long suggests that the product is sustainable over time, adding to its value. However, the lack of information on capacity, data entropy, and history raises concerns about the robustness and overall reliability of the product, which tempers the price estimate. The market score of 0.5 reflects a moderate level of demand, supporting a reasonable valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
