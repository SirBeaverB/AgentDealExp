Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity, indicating it can handle a reasonable volume of data or users. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market suggests uncertainty in its overall effectiveness and demand. This price reflects a conservative estimate based on the available capacity.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement, which can be appealing in a competitive market. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle current demands, while low data entropy implies that the data is reliable and structured, which is a positive trait. However, the medium data life suggests that the product may not be top-tier in longevity. The market score of 0.4 shows there\'s some demand, but it\'s not overwhelmingly strong. Overall, these factors combined lead to a moderate expected price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
