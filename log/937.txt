Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable for customers looking to optimize their data products.

Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating potential for effectiveness. The low data entropy suggests that the data is structured and reliable, which is favorable for users. However, the medium data life and lack of historical data may limit its long-term value. The market score of 0.4 indicates some demand but not overwhelming. Overall, the product has some strengths but also notable limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
