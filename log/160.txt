{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 and adequate capacity, suggesting it can make a meaningful contribution to performance. However, the data life is short, which limits long-term value, and the medium data entropy indicates some complexity in data handling. The market score of 0.3 suggests there is limited demand, impacting the overall perceived value. Overall, while the product has potential, various traits indicate it may not be highly sought after.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can attract interest despite the medium data entropy and short data life. The market score of 0.3 suggests a reasonable level of demand, but the lack of historical data weakens the valuation. Overall, the product holds some value but is limited by its traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
