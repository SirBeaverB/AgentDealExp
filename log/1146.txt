Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing to potential users, especially if the market demand is rated at 0.5. However, several traits are NULL, which reduces the overall reliability and depth of the product's value proposition. This leads to a cautious estimate.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests that the product has a decent ability to enhance model performance, which is valuable in data-driven industries. The capacity being "enough" indicates that the product can handle the necessary data loads, and a medium data entropy suggests that there is a reasonable level of complexity and variability in the data it processes. Additionally, a long data life implies that the product will remain relevant for an extended period. The market rating of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, making it a promising product. However, the lack of historical data may limit the confidence in predicting its long-term success.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
