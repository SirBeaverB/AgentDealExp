Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and a long data life, which indicates it can provide ongoing value to users. However, the market score of 0.3 suggests a relatively low demand. Despite the lack of specific information on model performance and data entropy, the positive aspects of capacity and data life contribute to a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a reasonable enhancement in capabilities, which is favorable in competitive markets. The capacity being "enough" suggests the product can handle expected workloads, and a long data life implies durability and sustained value. However, the high data entropy might indicate complexity or challenges in data management, which could slightly offset value. Given the market score of 0.3, there is some demand, but the lack of historical data limits confidence.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1605.0
Dealing Process:

Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1500. The product has potential value due to its capacity and long data life, but the low market score of 0.3 indicates limited demand, which warrants a lower starting price.
