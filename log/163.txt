Buying Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle a reasonable amount of data or transactions. However, the short data life indicates that the insights or usefulness of the data may diminish quickly, possibly limiting its long-term value. The lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, History, and Market presents uncertainty, but the existing capacity allows for a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it offers some enhancement over existing solutions. The capacity is sufficient, suggesting it can handle relevant data needs. However, the medium data entropy and short data life may limit its long-term value and usability. The market score of 0.4 suggests a moderate demand, but not exceptionally high. Considering these factors, the expected price reflects a reasonable valuation for a product with these characteristics.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
