Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': 'The data product has a short data life and lacks specific performance and capacity traits, which indicates limited usefulness and potential for rapid obsolescence. The lack of available traits leads to uncertainty in its overall value.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which could attract interest in a competitive market (0.5). However, the short data life, combined with several NULL traits, limits the product's long-term value and usability. Therefore, the price reflects a balance of potential interest against the uncertainty due to missing information.", 'confidence': 'low'}
