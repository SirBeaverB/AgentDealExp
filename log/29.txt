Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable to users looking for improvements in their data processes. However, the lack of data regarding its life, history, and market limits the confidence in its overall value. Given that there is enough capacity and low data entropy, it suggests that the data product is stable and reliable, which adds some value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 suggests that the product offers a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing in a competitive market, especially where the market rating is at 0.4 indicating some demand. However, the short data life and low data entropy might limit its long-term utility. The capacity being "enough" indicates that it can handle expected workloads, but the absence of historical data raises concerns about reliability and proven effectiveness. Overall, the product has potential but also significant limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
