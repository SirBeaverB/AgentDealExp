Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in the model's performance, which could be valuable to potential users. The market score of 0.5 suggests a reasonable demand for such a product. However, the NULL traits, particularly capacity and data entropy, introduce uncertainty in assessing the product's full potential. Given these factors, a mid-range price reflects both its potential and the limitations of the available information.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement is a positive indicator, suggesting that the product can enhance performance by a noticeable margin. The market score of 0.5 indicates a moderate demand, which contributes positively to the potential valuation. However, the presence of several NULL traits limits the overall confidence in the product's comprehensiveness and reliability, leading to a more cautious price estimate.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
