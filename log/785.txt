Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle a reasonable amount of data or user requests. However, the lack of information on other critical traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market limits the confidence in its valuation. Given the importance of these factors in determining the true value of data products, a conservative price estimation is warranted.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance existing models effectively. The "enough" capacity suggests it can handle current user demands, while high data entropy indicates varied and rich data, potentially increasing its value. However, the medium data life suggests limited longevity, and the absence of historical performance data is a significant drawback, which lowers confidence in long-term reliability and prevents a higher valuation. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate potential demand, further supporting a mid-range price point.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
