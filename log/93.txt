Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 suggests that the product can enhance performance significantly, which is valuable in competitive markets. However, the absence of additional traits limits the understanding of its overall capacity, data lifecycle, and market positioning, which reduces confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate improvement over existing solutions, which could attract interest in a market with a rating of 0.5. However, the short data life and the presence of multiple NULL traits suggest limited long-term value and reliability. Therefore, the price reflects a balance between moderate potential and significant uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'low'}
