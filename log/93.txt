Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which could be valuable in data-driven applications. However, the lack of information regarding Data Life, History, and Market significantly reduces the confidence in the product's long-term viability and market demand. Given the traits available, a price reflecting moderate value has been assigned.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement score of 0.2 indicates a positive enhancement in performance, which is a valuable trait in data products. Additionally, having enough capacity and low data entropy suggests that the product is reliable and easier to manage. However, the medium data life and the absence of historical data indicate some limitations. The market score of 0.5 reflects a moderate demand, which supports a reasonable price. Overall, these factors contribute to a cautious yet optimistic valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
