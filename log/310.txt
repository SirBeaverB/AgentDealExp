Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has high data entropy, which suggests it contains a diverse range of information that could be valuable for analytics or machine learning applications. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement and data life limits its potential. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate interest, which also factors into the pricing.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The model shows a moderate performance improvement (MPI of 0.2) and sufficient capacity to handle data. However, high data entropy suggests complexity and potential challenges in data interpretation. The short data life indicates that the product may not provide long-term value, but the market score of 0.4 reflects a decent demand. Given these mixed signals, the expected price is set at a moderate level.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
