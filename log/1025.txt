Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': 'The lack of specific traits, especially Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy, indicates that there is insufficient information to support a higher valuation. The capacity being "enough" suggests it can handle a reasonable amount of data, but without clear performance metrics or market context, the value remains limited.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance, which can attract interest in the market. The capacity is adequate, suggesting the product can handle a decent amount of data. However, the medium data entropy and short data life could hinder long-term usability, affecting its overall value. Given the market score of 0.4, there is demand, but the lack of historical data limits confidence in the product's reliability.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
