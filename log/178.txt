Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and a moderate market score of 0.5, indicating some demand, but it lacks key performance metrics and other critical traits. This suggests a basic product with potential but limited immediate value.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance, which could attract interest in the market. However, the data life being short and data entropy being medium suggests that the product may not have long-term utility. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand. Overall, these factors suggest a competitive but cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
