Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': "The market score of 0.4 indicates a moderate level of demand for the product, but the absence of specific traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, and History limits the overall confidence in the product's value. Despite this, there is still some market interest, hence a conservative estimate is warranted.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a reasonable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, and a market score of 0.4 suggests some demand, although the NULL traits indicate a lack of comprehensive data which limits the overall assessment. The medium data life adds some value, but the missing capacity and data entropy are significant gaps.', 'confidence': 'low'}
