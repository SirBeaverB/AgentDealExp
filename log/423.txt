Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and a long data life, indicating it can support ongoing use without degradation. The high data entropy suggests that the data is complex and potentially valuable for various analyses. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement and market conditions limits the potential valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating that it can enhance performance effectively. Additionally, it has a long data life, which suggests lasting utility. However, the presence of high data entropy may indicate complexity in data management, which could deter some users. The market score of 0.5 indicates a moderate demand, but the overall value is supported by the positive traits present.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
