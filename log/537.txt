Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which could be valuable to businesses looking to optimize their models. However, the lack of data on entropy, life, and market limits the overall assessment of its potential value. Given the improvement, I estimate a reasonable price, but the uncertainties reduce confidence.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': "The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating that it has the potential to enhance outcomes. Additionally, low data entropy and a long data life suggest that the data is stable and reliable over time, which is valuable in many applications. The market size is moderate at 0.3, indicating reasonable demand, but the lack of historical data means there is some uncertainty about the product's track record. Overall, these factors combined justify a price in the mid-range for data products.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
