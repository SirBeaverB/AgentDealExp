Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a low data entropy, indicating that the data quality is likely high and can lead to reliable insights. However, the NULL traits suggest a lack of important information that would typically contribute to a more accurate valuation, such as Model Performance Improvement and specific market context. Given the balance of a strong trait and several unknowns, a conservative price is justified.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates it can enhance existing models to some extent. The capacity is sufficient, and low data entropy suggests that the data is relatively structured and reliable. However, the medium data life indicates that the data may not remain relevant for an extended period, and the market score of 0.5 implies a moderate demand. These factors combined suggest a reasonable price point.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
