Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'Despite several traits being NULL, the long data life indicates the product could provide value over time. Additionally, the market score of 0.4 suggests there is some demand, although it is not very high. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a conservative estimate based on potential longevity and limited market engagement.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate level of improvement, which can be valuable in certain markets. The long data life suggests that the product can remain relevant for an extended period, potentially enhancing its value. However, the NULL traits indicate a lack of critical information regarding capacity and data entropy, which diminishes the overall confidence in the valuation. The market score of 0.4 suggests a moderate level of interest as well. Overall, while the product has some valuable traits, the uncertainty from the NULL values leads to a cautious price estimation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate improvement in model performance and the long data life, which enhances its overall value. While there are some uncertainties due to NULL traits, I believe the potential benefits justify a higher initial price.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 2500. This price reflects a more balanced consideration of the product's potential value over time, along with the moderate market demand.

Round 2 (Seller): I offer 2400. This price reflects a balanced recognition of the potential value and market demand for the data, while taking into account the moderate model performance improvements and the uncertainties related to NULL traits. I believe this is a fair compromise between the offers presented in the last round.
