Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity, which is a positive trait, but the lack of information on essential traits like Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy limits its potential. The short data life also reduces long-term value. However, a market value of 0.3 suggests there is some demand, justifying a modest price.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate level of enhancement, which can attract buyers looking for incremental gains. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle typical usage without issues. However, the low data entropy means the data is likely consistent and reliable, which is a positive trait. The short data life could limit the product\'s long-term value, but given the current market demand of 0.3, there is still potential for a reasonable price. The absence of historical data is a concern, but the other traits provide a basis for valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
