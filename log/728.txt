Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': 'The product has a high data entropy, indicating it contains diverse and complex data, which can be valuable in certain market applications. However, the short data life reduces its long-term usability, and the lack of model performance improvement and history suggests uncertainty in its effectiveness. Given the low market demand score, the valuation is modest.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates potential for enhancing performance in relevant applications. However, the high data entropy suggests variability and complexity in the data, which can be both a challenge and an opportunity depending on the use case. The short data life implies that the data may become obsolete quickly, which could limit its overall value. The market value of 0.3 suggests a low demand within the current market, affecting pricing. Overall, while the product has some positive aspects, the limitations in data life and market potential lead to a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of the data product, which indicates its potential to enhance performance in relevant applications despite the challenges posed by its high data entropy and short data life. The unique characteristics of this data set suggest that it holds significant value for the right use case.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 300. The high data entropy and short data life significantly diminish its long-term usability and value, especially given the low market demand. Therefore, a more modest offer is warranted considering these factors.
