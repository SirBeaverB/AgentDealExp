{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'low'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.2 indicates a noticeable enhancement over baseline models, which is valuable in competitive markets. The low data entropy suggests that the data is highly structured and reliable, making it easier to draw insights and implement in applications. However, the NULL values for Data Life and History introduce uncertainty, which affects overall confidence in the product's longevity and applicability. The market value of 0.3 indicates a moderate demand, which also supports a reasonable price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a reasonable enhancement, while the low data entropy suggests high reliability and quality of the data. However, the medium data life and the market score of 0.3 suggest limited demand and potential longevity in the market. These factors balance each other out to form a moderate expected price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the exceptional quality of the data, as indicated by the Model Performance Improvement of 0.2, and the high reliability suggested by low data entropy. While the medium data life and market score indicate some limitations, the overall value justifies this premium price.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400. The improvement in model performance is valuable, but the NULL values for Data Life and History introduce uncertainty regarding the product's longevity and applicability. Therefore, I believe a lower price is more appropriate given these factors.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1600. This price reflects the exceptional quality and reliability of the data while considering the uncertainties related to NULL values that I previously mentioned. I believe this is a fair compromise that values the product appropriately.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1500. I believe this price strikes a balance between the quality of the data and the concerns regarding NULL values. It reflects my willingness to negotiate while recognizing the value of the product.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1550. This price reflects the balance between the exceptional quality of the data and the lingering concerns regarding NULL values, ensuring a fair deal for both parties.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1560. I believe this slight increase reflects the inherent value of the data while acknowledging the seller's concerns about NULL values. It positions us toward a mutually beneficial agreement while still recognizing the quality of the product at hand.
