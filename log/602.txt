Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate improvement over existing models, which can attract interest from potential buyers. The market score of 0.4 suggests there is some demand for the product, though it may not be as strong as it could be if more traits were available. However, the presence of NULL traits (Data Entropy, Data Life, History) limits the confidence in the product's overall value.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a reasonable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates it can enhance existing models. However, the short data life and medium data entropy suggest that the product may not be highly durable or stable in the long term. The market value of 0.4 indicates a moderate demand, but the lack of historical data reduces confidence in predicting long-term success. Thus, while it has potential, the overall valuation reflects some risk.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
