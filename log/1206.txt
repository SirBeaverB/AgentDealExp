Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product has high data entropy, which suggests that it contains diverse and complex data, potentially making it valuable for applications requiring rich datasets. However, the market demand is relatively low at 0.3, indicating limited interest or competition. The NULL traits regarding model performance improvement and data life reduce confidence in the product's overall effectiveness and longevity, which tempers the expected price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be appealing to businesses looking to optimize their data products. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle a reasonable amount of data, which adds additional value. However, the high data entropy implies complexity that might deter some users, while the medium data life suggests the product has a finite utility period. Given these factors and the market score of 0.3, the expected price is moderate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in model performance, along with the product's reasonable data capacity, making it an attractive option for businesses looking to optimize their data products. The complexity indicated by the high data entropy adds unique value, justifying this premium.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400.
