Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to potential users looking for efficiency gains. However, the lack of critical data traits such as Capacity, Data Entropy, and History limits the overall evaluation. Given the long Data Life, the product has potential longevity in the market, but the uncertainty affects confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product demonstrates a notable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates that it can enhance existing models significantly. Additionally, the long Data Life suggests that the product can be utilized for an extended period, providing ongoing value. However, the NULL traits, particularly concerning Capacity and Data Entropy, limit the overall confidence in the valuation. The market value of 0.4 suggests a moderate demand, which influences the price positively but also indicates potential competition or saturation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1800.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2000. This price reflects the significant Model Performance Improvement of 0.25 the product provides, which can greatly enhance existing models. Additionally, the long Data Life indicates ongoing value, justifying a premium price despite some limitations in capacity and data entropy.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400. While I recognize the value of the Model Performance Improvement, I believe the limitations in critical data traits warrant a lower initial offer. My confidence in reaching a reasonable agreement remains strong.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the significant model performance improvements while considering the limitations pointed out by the other analyst. It's a fair compromise that values the long data life and the enhancements provided without undervaluing the product.
