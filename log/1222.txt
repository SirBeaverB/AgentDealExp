Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and high data entropy, suggesting it can handle a significant amount of complex data. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement and data life limits its overall potential. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, which supports a reasonable price expectation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a decent enhancement in performance, while a high data entropy suggests that the data is complex and valuable. The medium data life implies that the product can still be useful over a reasonable time frame. The market demand of 0.4 signals a moderate interest, which can support a viable pricing strategy. However, the lack of historical data limits the confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
