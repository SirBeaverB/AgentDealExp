Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate improvement in model performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. However, the high data entropy suggests that the data may be complex and potentially challenging to work with. The lack of available information regarding data life, history, and market makes it difficult to ascertain long-term value and demand. Therefore, the expected price reflects a balance between the potential benefits of the MPI and the uncertainties posed by the NULL traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model shows a decent improvement in performance (MPI of 0.25) which indicates some level of effectiveness. However, the high data entropy and short data life suggest that the data may not be reliable for long-term use, which could limit its overall value. The market score of 0.3 indicates a moderate demand, but the lack of historical performance data (NULL) lowers the confidence in the product's reliability.", 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2000. This price reflects the potential value of the data product, considering the decent improvement in performance and the moderate demand in the market. While there are some concerns about reliability, I believe the data's effectiveness warrants a premium price.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1500. While I recognize the seller's perspective on the data product's potential value, I believe that with the current uncertainties regarding reliability and market demand, a lower price is more appropriate. My offer reflects a cautious approach given these concerns.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1600. This price reflects my confidence in the data product's potential while still acknowledging the uncertainties about its reliability and market demand. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both parties' valuations.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1550. I believe this price strikes a balance between acknowledging the seller's concerns about reliability and market demand while still valuing the potential of the data product.
