Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 0.3), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates that the product has some level of effectiveness, which can attract buyers looking for solutions that enhance model performance. However, the data life being short and several traits being NULL limits the product's long-term value and reliability, thereby reducing the price. The market score of 0.3 suggests a moderate demand, but the overall uncertainty from the NULL traits affects confidence in the valuation.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a modest enhancement in performance, but the short data life and lack of other key traits (such as capacity and data entropy) significantly limit its value. The market score of 0.3 suggests low demand, further influencing the pricing.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Deal Price:967.5

Round 1 (Seller): I offer 800. This initial price reflects the potential value of the data product, considering its modest model performance improvement, despite the limitations in data life and demand.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1000. This price reflects a reasonable adjustment considering the product's limitations, particularly the short data life and NULL traits, while acknowledging its potential for model performance improvement.
