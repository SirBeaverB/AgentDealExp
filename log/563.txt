Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and a long data life, which suggests it can be used effectively over time. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data entropy, and market demands introduces uncertainty. Given the available traits, a conservative price reflecting its potential utility is reasonable.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance existing models to a certain degree. The low data entropy suggests the data is clean and reliable, which is appealing for users. Additionally, the long data life indicates sustainability and continued relevance. The market score of 0.5 suggests there is some demand, but not overwhelming. However, the NULL history trait limits confidence in the product's past effectiveness, which could affect its perceived value.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
