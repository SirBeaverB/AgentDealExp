Buying Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and high data entropy, which suggests it can provide valuable insights despite the lack of information on model performance improvement and history. The medium data life indicates it can remain relevant for a moderate period, and the market score of 0.4 suggests a reasonable demand, though not exceptionally high.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a satisfactory enhancement in performance, which can be appealing in a competitive market. Although the data entropy is high, suggesting complexity and potential for insights, the medium data life limits long-term utility. The market score of 0.4 shows an average demand. With enough capacity, it indicates that the product can handle the expected workload. However, the lack of historical data reduces confidence in the product's proven track record.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
