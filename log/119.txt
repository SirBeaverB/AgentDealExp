{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'low'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life, low data entropy, and sufficient capacity, which suggests that it can provide stable and reliable insights over time. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement and market specifics diminishes the overall valuation. The expected price reflects the potential value based on the available data traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates that it can enhance existing models effectively. Additionally, the capacity is sufficient, and the data life is long, suggesting durability and usability over time. The low data entropy implies that the data is reliable and consistent. However, the market value is moderate at 0.4, which suggests that while there is demand, it may not be overwhelmingly high. Since there are no NULL traits impacting critical aspects of the product, this gives a reasonable level of confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'high'}
