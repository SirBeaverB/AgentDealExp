{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating that it can enhance model performance to a certain extent, which is beneficial in data-driven industries. However, the lack of critical information such as Data Entropy, History, and Market potential limits the confidence in its overall value. The medium Data Life suggests it has a decent lifespan but may not be groundbreaking. Given these factors, a valuation around 5000 is reasonable.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 suggests a decent level of enhancement, which can be attractive to potential buyers. The capacity being sufficient implies that the product can handle demand, while a medium data entropy and life indicate that the product is relatively stable and usable over time. However, the market score of 0.3 suggests moderate demand, and the absence of historical data may limit confidence in predicting long-term performance or acceptance.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
