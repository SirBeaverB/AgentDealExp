Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life, which suggests it could provide prolonged value and utility over time. However, the lack of information on other key traits such as Model Performance Improvement and Capacity limits the confidence in the valuation. The expected price reflects a moderate value based on the long data life.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable to users looking to optimize their models. However, the NULL values for capacity, data entropy, and history limit the understanding of the product's full potential and applicability. The long data life suggests durability and continued relevance in the market. The market score of 0.4 shows that there is some demand, but it's not very high. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a moderate expected price.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
