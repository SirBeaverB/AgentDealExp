Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product has a medium data life and sufficient capacity, which indicates it can be utilized effectively for a reasonable period. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data entropy, history, and market limits confidence in the product's overall value. Despite these gaps, a base price reflects its potential utility.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance performance to some extent. The capacity is sufficient, and the low data entropy suggests that the data is reliable and consistent, which enhances its potential value. However, the medium data life and lack of historical data introduce some uncertainty in long-term viability. The market rating of 0.3 indicates a niche demand. Overall, these factors suggest a moderate pricing strategy.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1625.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2000. This price reflects the moderate Model Performance Improvement of 0.25 and the reliable data quality indicated by low entropy. While the medium data life introduces some uncertainties, the potential value justifies a higher starting price.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1400. The product's medium data life and uncertainties regarding model performance and market limits lead me to believe that a more cautious approach is warranted. While I recognize the potential value, my valuation reflects the gaps in information and the overall risk involved.

Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1700. This price reflects my continued assessment of the medium data life and uncertainties, while still acknowledging the seller's moderate model performance improvement and low data entropy. I believe this price strikes a reasonable balance and moves us closer to a fair agreement.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1750. This price reflects my recognition of the medium data life and the need for a fair balance between our positions, while still valuing the moderate model performance improvements and low data entropy.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1650. This price reflects my assessment of the ongoing negotiations and the need for a balanced approach, considering the moderate model performance improvements and the uncertainties surrounding the medium data life. I believe this price keeps the conversation moving forward while still being fair and reasonable.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1700. This price reflects a fair compromise considering the previous discussions, the moderate model performance, and the low data entropy. I believe this offer balances the need for a reasonable agreement while acknowledging the uncertainties surrounding data life.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 1600. I believe this price reflects a fair valuation considering the moderate model performance and the uncertainties surrounding data life. It allows us to move closer to a deal while still addressing the risks involved.
Round 5 (Seller): I offer 1650. I believe this price reflects a reasonable balance between the data's moderate performance and the uncertainties discussed previously, while also showing my willingness to negotiate. Let's find a fair agreement that acknowledges the value of the data.
