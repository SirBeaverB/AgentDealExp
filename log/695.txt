Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and a long data life, indicating it can provide value over time. However, the medium data entropy suggests that while the data is not overly complex, it may not be highly unique either. The absence of information on Model Performance Improvement and market makes the valuation less certain, but a baseline price can be established based on the available traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance performance to some extent. The capacity is sufficient, and the data life is long, suggesting longevity and sustainability in usage. However, medium data entropy indicates variability that may not appeal to all users. The market score of 0.4 suggests a low to moderate demand, which affects the valuation. Overall, while there are positive traits, the market demand and data entropy limit the maximum potential price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
