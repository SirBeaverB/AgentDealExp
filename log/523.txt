{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a significant enhancement in model accuracy or efficiency, which is valuable in data-driven industries. The capacity being "enough" suggests the product can handle a reasonable amount of data, making it applicable for small to medium enterprises. However, the lack of information on data entropy and market limits the confidence in the valuation, as understanding the competitive landscape and specific data characteristics would better inform the potential price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement over baseline models, suggesting potential effectiveness in applications. The market score of 0.5 indicates average demand, while low data entropy suggests the data is reliable and manageable. However, the medium data life and lack of historical data reduce the overall confidence in long-term value. These factors lead to a conservative estimate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
