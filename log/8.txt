Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('small', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': ([2500, 3300, 3100, 8100, 2900], [2500, 3300, 3100, 8100, 2900]), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The product has a short data life and several NULL traits, indicating limited potential for performance improvement and capacity. The history shows fluctuating values, with a peak at 8100, but the market score of 0.3 suggests low demand. Therefore, the price is set at the lower end of the historical range.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement, but the small capacity and low data entropy suggest limited applicability. The short data life implies that the product may not provide long-term value, and the market score of 0.3 indicates low demand. Given these factors, a price of 2000 reflects a cautious valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:2400.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2500. This price reflects the moderate enhancement indicated by the Model Performance Improvement of 0.2, despite the limitations in data capacity and low demand. I believe this price captures the potential value of the product while still considering its constraints.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 2000. This price reflects the limitations of the product, including its short data life and several NULL traits, which indicate a reduced potential for performance improvement. Given the market score of 0.3 and low demand, I believe this offer is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
