Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life, which indicates that it may have a useful lifespan for a moderate period, allowing for some value. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, capacity, data entropy, and history significantly limits the ability to assess its overall utility and market fit. Therefore, the expected price is modest.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 and the Market score of 0.4 indicate that there is potential value in the product, suggesting that it can provide a meaningful enhancement in performance. However, the NULL values for Capacity, Data Entropy, and History limit the ability to fully evaluate its worth. Given the medium Data Life, I estimate a moderate price reflecting the potential benefits while accounting for the uncertainty due to missing traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
