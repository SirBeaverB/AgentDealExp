Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and a long data life, which suggests it can serve a stable market for an extended period. However, the absence of specific metrics regarding model performance, data entropy, and historical data limits full confidence in its potential effectiveness and marketability. Therefore, the price reflects a moderate value based on its available strengths.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can attract interest from businesses looking to improve their analytics. Additionally, the data life being long suggests that the product will remain relevant and useful for an extended period. While the market score of 0.3 is relatively low, the other factors provide a foundation for value. However, the presence of 'NULL' in history limits confidence in predicting long-term trends and customer acceptance.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
