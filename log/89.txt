{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product lacks critical information about its performance, capacity, and other relevant traits, making it difficult to assess its true value. However, a base value is assigned considering potential market interest in data products, even with incomplete information.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which could be appealing in a competitive market. However, the short data life and many NULL traits (including capacity and data entropy) suggest limited long-term value and usability of the product. The market score of 0.5 implies there is some demand, but not strong enough to significantly increase the price.', 'confidence': 'low'}
