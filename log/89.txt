Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. However, the absence of critical traits such as Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market limits the overall confidence in the product's value. Despite these limitations, a reasonable price is justifiable given the MPI.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 suggests that the product has a moderate ability to enhance performance, indicating potential value. The capacity being "enough" implies it can handle current data needs, while low data entropy suggests that the data is clean and reliable, which is a positive trait. However, the medium data life indicates that the product may not be suitable for long-term use without updates. The market score of 0.5 suggests there\'s a decent demand, though not overwhelming. Overall, the combination of these traits can support a reasonable valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
