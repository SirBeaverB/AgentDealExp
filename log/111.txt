Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive to potential buyers. However, the lack of information on capacity, data entropy, and market context raises concerns about the overall value. Given the medium data life, the product has some longevity but without a clear market demand, the valuation remains conservative.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a decent improvement in performance, which can attract interest from potential buyers. However, the NULL values for capacity and data entropy suggest a lack of critical information that could enhance the product's appeal. The medium data life indicates reliability over time, and the market score of 0.4 shows a moderate demand, which supports a reasonable price point. With these factors in mind, a price of 15,000 reflects a balance between potential and uncertainty.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
