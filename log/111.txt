Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates a positive enhancement in its capabilities. With low data entropy and a long data life, it suggests the data is reliable and valuable over time. However, the lack of historical and market data limits the confidence in assessing its overall market demand and pricing. Given these considerations, a mid-range price is reasonable.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a decent Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates potential for enhancing existing models. With low data entropy, it suggests the data is relatively uniform and easier to work with, which is favorable for many applications. The long data life adds value as it implies sustainability and ongoing usefulness of the data. However, the market demand is relatively low at 0.3, which may limit pricing potential. The lack of historical data could affect perceived reliability. Overall, the combination of these traits justifies a moderate pricing.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
