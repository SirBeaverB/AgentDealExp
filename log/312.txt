Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity and high data entropy, indicating it can handle complex data effectively. However, the short data life and lack of historical performance metrics suggest limited long-term value. The market demand is moderate at 0.4, which reflects cautious interest in the product. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a reasonable price point, albeit with some reservations due to the short data lifespan and incomplete trait data.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 and a sufficient capacity, which suggests it can deliver meaningful results. However, the high data entropy indicates complexity and potential challenges in data handling. The short data life implies that while the product may be useful now, its longevity is questionable, which could limit its value. The market demand is moderate at 0.4, suggesting there is some interest, but perhaps not overwhelming. Overall, these factors balance out to a moderate expected price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
