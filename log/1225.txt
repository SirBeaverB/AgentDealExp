Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can add value to various data-driven applications. However, the lack of additional traits such as Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market limits the overall confidence in the valuation. Given that the capacity is sufficient, this price reflects a balance between the existing performance improvement and the uncertainty due to missing traits.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates that it can effectively enhance performance metrics. The capacity is sufficient, and while data entropy is high, suggesting potential variability and richness in the data, the medium data life indicates that the information may not be as fresh over time. The market score of 0.4 reflects a moderate demand. However, the lack of historical data limits confidence in the valuation. Overall, considering the positive aspects alongside the limitations, a price of 15,000 seems reasonable.', 'confidence': '70'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 18000. This price reflects the significant model performance improvement of 0.3, indicating the product's strong potential to enhance performance metrics. Additionally, the data's richness and variability, despite the medium life expectancy, contribute to its value. I believe this price captures the unique benefits and market potential of the product effectively.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1000. Given the moderate performance improvement indicated by the MPI of 0.3 and the absence of additional critical traits, I believe this price more accurately reflects the uncertainties surrounding the data product's overall value.
