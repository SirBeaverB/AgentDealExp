{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. However, the lack of additional traits such as Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market details significantly limits the confidence in the valuation, as these factors often contribute to understanding the product\'s overall effectiveness and longevity. Despite this, the capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle demand, contributing positively to its valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance which is valuable for users looking to improve their models. The capacity is sufficient, and the data life is long, suggesting reliability and longevity of the product. However, the high data entropy indicates complexity and potential challenges in data handling. The market score of 0.5 suggests moderate demand but not overwhelming. Given these traits, the product seems promising, but the NULL history trait raises some uncertainty about its track record. Thus, a price of 1500 reflects its potential while accounting for the uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the promising Model Performance Improvement and the reliability of the data product, despite some complexities and uncertainties. I believe this valuation captures the product's potential for users looking to enhance their models effectively.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. The offered price of 1800 is significantly below my expected value of 5000, and I believe that given the uncertainties surrounding the data product, a lower price is more appropriate. I want to ensure we can reach a fair agreement that reflects the value while also accounting for the complexities involved.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1750. This price reflects the unique value and potential of the product while maintaining room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges your concerns while still recognizing the worth of what I'm offering.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1700. I appreciate your offer of 1750, but I still feel that given the uncertainties and the expected value of the product, 1700 is a more reasonable price that reflects both the potential and the inherent risks involved. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1725. The product has significant unique value and potential for model performance improvement, which justifies a price close to my previous offer while remaining competitive in this negotiation.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1680. The seller's offer of 1725 is still above my threshold, but I believe that my offer reflects a fair value considering the uncertainties and risks involved while also acknowledging the product's unique features. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 1700. The product has significant potential for performance enhancement, and I believe this price reflects its unique value while still being a reasonable compromise given our previous discussions.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price acknowledges the product's potential while still reflecting the uncertainties and risks involved. It's a fair compromise that builds on our previous discussions.
Round 5 (Seller): I offer 1675. The product has significant potential and unique value, and I'm willing to come down slightly to facilitate a deal while still reflecting its worth.
Round 5 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the unique value of the product while still acknowledging the risks involved.
Round 6 (Seller): I offer 1665. The product's unique attributes and potential for performance improvement justify a competitive price, and I believe this offer strikes a fair balance between value and the buyer's concerns about uncertainties.
Round 6 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, considering the unique value of the product while still acknowledging the uncertainties we've discussed. It's a reasonable step towards closing the deal.
