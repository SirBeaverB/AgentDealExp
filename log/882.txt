Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product has an adequate capacity and a moderate market score of 0.4, indicating potential demand. However, the lack of information on key traits like model performance improvement and data entropy limits confidence in the product's capabilities. Given these factors, a conservative price reflects its potential yet acknowledges uncertainty.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which could attract buyers looking for improvements. The market score of 0.4 suggests there is some demand, although it is not exceptionally high. The low data entropy indicates stable data, which is a positive aspect. However, the short data life and the NULL history suggest limited long-term value. Therefore, the expected price reflects a balance between these factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:No deal.
