Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product has adequate capacity and a market demand of 0.4, indicating some interest. However, the absence of critical traits like model performance improvement, data entropy, data life, and history limits the product's perceived value. The expected price reflects a cautious valuation based on the existing market interest and capacity.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a significant enhancement in performance, which can be highly valuable in a competitive market. The capacity being "enough" indicates that the product can handle the required workload, and a long data life suggests sustainability and ongoing relevance. However, the high data entropy may imply complexity, which could affect usability. The market rating of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, which aligns with the potential for value despite some uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
