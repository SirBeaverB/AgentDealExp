Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle data needs adequately. However, the short data life raises concerns about its longevity and potential usefulness over time. The lack of other traits (like Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy) provides limited insight into its overall effectiveness and market fit, which tempers confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing depending on the application. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle its intended use. However, the high data entropy and short data life may limit long-term usability and reliability. The market score of 0.3 reflects low demand or niche application potential. Given these factors, the expected price is moderate, acknowledging the trade-offs in performance and longevity.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
