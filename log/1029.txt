Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and medium data entropy, which suggests it can handle a reasonable volume of data and offers some variability in the dataset. However, the NULL traits indicate a lack of information about model performance and other critical factors, which limits confidence in its overall value. Given these considerations, the expected price reflects a moderate valuation based on available traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product demonstrates a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates some effectiveness in enhancing performance. The market is rated at 0.4, suggesting a reasonable level of demand. However, the short data life and medium data entropy could limit long-term value. Given these factors, a price of 1500 reflects a balanced assessment of its potential and limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1655.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate Model Performance Improvement of our data product and the reasonable market demand, while also considering its limitations like short data life and medium data entropy. I believe this valuation captures the potential value effectively.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. The seller's price does not reflect the medium data entropy and limitations of the product adequately. Given these factors, I believe my offer is a more reasonable valuation for the data product.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. The product's medium data entropy and moderate performance justify a higher price than the buyer's last offer, reflecting its value in the current market.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1650. This price reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's limitations while still considering its market value. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring I don't overextend beyond my valuation.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1660. This price reflects a balanced assessment of the product's value, taking into account its medium data entropy and the reasonable market demand, while also recognizing the buyer's perspective from the last round.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1650. I believe this price strikes a fair balance considering the product's value and its limitations, while also reflecting my previous offers and the seller's current stance. It's a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the seller's perspective while still aiming to secure a beneficial deal for both parties.
