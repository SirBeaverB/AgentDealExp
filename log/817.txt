{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product has sufficient capacity, which indicates it can handle the necessary data requirements. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market reduces confidence in the product's overall effectiveness and marketability. Therefore, while a base value can be established due to capacity, the overall uncertainty leads to a moderate valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing in competitive markets. The high data entropy suggests that the data is diverse and potentially valuable for various use cases, while a long data life indicates that the data will remain relevant over time. However, the history trait being NULL raises some concerns about the product's track record, which could limit its attractiveness to potential buyers. Given the market value of 0.3, there is a reasonable demand for such products. Overall, the combination of these factors leads to a moderate valuation.", 'confidence': 'moderate'}
