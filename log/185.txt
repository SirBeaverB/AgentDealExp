Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The absence of traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market makes it difficult to accurately assess the product's value. However, I am assuming a baseline price due to the potential utility of an unspecified data product in a data-driven market, which often retains some intrinsic value even when detailed information is lacking.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which could be appealing in competitive markets. However, the NULL values for capacity and data entropy limit the overall assessment of the product's potential. Given that the market score is 0.5, it suggests a reasonable level of demand but also uncertainty. The medium data life indicates it has a decent lifespan for relevance. Considering these factors, the expected price reflects a balance between potential value and the uncertainty from the missing traits.", 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 6000. This price reflects the significant potential of the data product, considering its moderate Model Performance Improvement and decent lifespan for relevance. The competitive market demands high-quality data, and I believe this price captures the value effectively.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 5000. This price reflects my assessment of the data product's value given the lack of critical performance metrics and market traits, which makes it challenging to justify a higher bid. I believe this price aligns more closely with the intrinsic value of the product in its current state.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 5500. The market demand for this data product is strong, and while I acknowledge the concerns about performance metrics, I believe the potential justifies a price above 5000. Let's find a common ground that reflects the value of this product.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 5700. The strong market demand for this data product, coupled with its significant potential, supports a price that is higher than 5500. I believe this revised offer better reflects the value we can both achieve in this deal. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4 (Seller): I offer 6000. The strong market demand and the potential value of the data product justify a higher price, and I believe this reflects its true worth. Let's continue to explore this opportunity.
