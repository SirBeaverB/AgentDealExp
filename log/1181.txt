Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a significant enhancement in model performance, which can be very valuable to businesses looking to improve their data-driven results. However, the high data entropy suggests complexity and variability in the data, which may require additional processing or expertise to leverage effectively. The lack of information on data life, history, and market limits confidence, but the potential for improvement is noteworthy.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.3 indicates a reasonable enhancement in performance, which could be appealing in a competitive market. However, the data entropy is high, suggesting unpredictability and potential challenges in usability. The short data life limits its long-term value, and the lack of historical data makes it difficult to assess reliability. The market score of 0.4 indicates moderate demand, which should be factored into the price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
