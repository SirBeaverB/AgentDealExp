{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a sufficient capacity for usage, but the short data life indicates it may have limited long-term value. The market score of 0.4 suggests a relatively low demand and potential market saturation. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a moderate valuation, compensating for the lack of several key traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can attract buyers looking for incremental gains. The market score of 0.4 suggests there is some demand, but it is not overwhelming. The medium data entropy implies that the data quality is decent, though the short data life limits long-term usability. Overall, while there are some positive traits, the short data life and the presence of NULL in history reduce the overall confidence in the value, leading to a moderate price estimate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
