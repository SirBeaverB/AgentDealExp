{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product shows a solid Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating that it has the potential to enhance model effectiveness, which is valuable in data-driven markets. The market trait of 0.3 suggests a moderate demand for the product. However, the presence of several NULL traits (Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, History) limits the overall understanding of the product's full potential and applicability, which decreases confidence in the valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in model accuracy or efficiency, which could be appealing in certain markets. However, the short data life and lack of available traits such as capacity and data entropy limit the product's long-term value and usability. Given this, the expected price reflects potential but is tempered by uncertainty.", 'confidence': 'low'}
