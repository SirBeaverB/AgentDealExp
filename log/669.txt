Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 suggests a moderate enhancement in model accuracy or effectiveness, which is a valuable trait for users seeking improved performance. However, the lack of key traits such as Data Life, History, and Market limits the overall valuation. Nonetheless, the capacity is sufficient, indicating that the product can handle its intended workload. Considering these factors, a moderate price is warranted.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates it can enhance existing models but may not be groundbreaking. The capacity is sufficient, which is a positive trait. However, the medium data entropy and medium data life suggest that the data may not be highly unique or long-lasting. The market score of 0.5 indicates a reasonable demand but not overwhelming. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a fair market value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 2500. This data product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement of 0.25, which can significantly enhance existing models. While the data has medium entropy and life, it still holds considerable value in a reasonable market with a score of 0.5. I believe this price reflects its potential to provide substantial benefits to your operations.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 2000. Considering the moderate Model Performance Improvement of 0.25, while the product does hold some value, the lack of key traits such as Data Life and History limits its overall potential. Therefore, a price of 2000 better reflects the product's current valuation and my budget constraints.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 2200. This price reflects the moderate value of the data product while taking into account the limitations in Data Life and History. I believe this offer strikes a balance between recognizing the product's potential and ensuring a fair deal.

Round 3 (Seller): I offer 2150. Given the moderate Model Performance Improvement, I believe this price reflects a fair value for the data product while considering its limitations. Let's work towards a deal that acknowledges the strengths and weaknesses of the product.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 2100. Given the moderate Model Performance Improvement and the need to acknowledge the limitations of the data product, I believe this price is a fair compromise that reflects its value while still being considerate of the market conditions. Let's finalize this deal.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 2120. This price reflects a balanced consideration of the data product's value and its limitations while also acknowledging the buyer's previous offers.
