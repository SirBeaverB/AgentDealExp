Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and sufficient capacity, indicating that it can store and manage data effectively over time. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data entropy, history, and market context limits the overall assessment. Despite this, the long data life and adequate capacity suggest a baseline value, which is why I estimate the price at 5000.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance performance to some extent, which is valuable in a competitive market. The capacity is sufficient, and the data life is long, suggesting longevity in its usability. However, the medium data entropy might indicate some complexity in data interpretation. The market value of 0.3 suggests a limited but existing demand for this type of product. Overall, these traits align with a reasonable price point, balancing potential performance benefits and market conditions.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
