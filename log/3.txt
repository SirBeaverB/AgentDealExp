{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': 'The product has enough capacity but a short data life and multiple NULL traits, which indicates limited potential and lack of clarity in its performance and market application. This suggests a lower market value.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be beneficial in certain applications. However, the low data entropy suggests that the data may not be highly diverse or complex, potentially limiting its applicability. The short data life may also reduce long-term value, but the capacity being sufficient means it can handle existing demands. The market score of 0.3 reflects a niche demand which can yield a reasonable price but is not overly high. Overall, the combination of these factors suggests a moderate valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the moderate enhancement in model performance indicated by the Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, as well as the sufficient capacity to meet existing demands. While the data may have limitations due to low entropy and a short data life, the niche market score of 0.3 suggests there is value to be leveraged here. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 300. The data product has significant limitations due to its short data life and multiple NULL traits, which severely restrict its potential and market application. Given these factors, a lower price reflects a more realistic valuation.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 400. I believe this price reflects a fair value considering the data's significant constraints and the limited timeframe of its relevance.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 500. I believe this price acknowledges the seller's constraints while still reflecting the potential value of the data. It's a reasonable step towards reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 600. I believe this price reflects the potential value of the data while still acknowledging its limitations. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 550. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the data's limitations while still recognizing its potential value. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
Round 4 (Seller): I offer 700. This new price reflects the value of the data while considering its constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the potential without overestimating the limitations.
Round 4 (Buyer): I offer 650. This price reflects my continued recognition of the data's potential value while still accounting for its limitations. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer that balances both our perspectives in this negotiation.
Round 5 (Seller): I offer 750. This price reflects my acknowledgment of the data's potential value while considering the limitations we've discussed. It's a step towards finding a fair compromise that recognizes both the data's strengths and its constraints.
Round 5 (Buyer): I offer 700. I believe this price is a fair compromise that accurately reflects the data's potential value while acknowledging its limitations. It's essential that we find common ground, and at this price, I am confident we can move forward effectively.
Round 6 (Seller): I offer 720. I believe this price acknowledges the data's potential value while remaining mindful of its limitations. It reflects a reasonable compromise that can facilitate a successful deal between us.
Round 6 (Buyer): I offer 700. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, acknowledging the data's potential value while remaining mindful of its limitations. It aligns closely with our previous discussions and facilitates a path towards a successful agreement.
