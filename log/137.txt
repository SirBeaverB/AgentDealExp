{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': "The lack of available traits limits the ability to assess the product's value accurately. With all traits being NULL, this indicates a significant uncertainty regarding its performance, capacity, and market applicability. Therefore, the expected price is set low to reflect this uncertainty.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a notable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates that it can enhance the performance of existing models significantly. The long data life suggests that the data remains relevant and usable for an extended period, potentially increasing its value. However, the NULL traits for capacity, data entropy, and history limit the overall assessment, especially regarding the product's scalability and detailed performance metrics. The market score of 0.5 suggests moderate demand, reinforcing the potential value but also highlighting uncertainty.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1600.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the significant Model Performance Improvement of 0.25, which can greatly enhance existing models, combined with the long data life that maintains its relevance and usability. Despite some limitations, I believe the product's overall value justifies this investment.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 900. This price reflects the significant uncertainty regarding the product's performance and applicability, given the lack of available traits. While I recognize its potential, my valuation must account for this ambiguity.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1500. The data product's significant model performance and long data life justify a strong valuation, and I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the differing perspectives on its applicability and performance.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1700. The model performance improvements and the data's long life significantly enhance its value, justifying a higher price than my previous offer while still remaining below the analyst's high valuation. This reflects a balanced view of the product's strengths and uncertainties.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1600. This price reflects the strong model performance and long data life that analysts are emphasizing, while also acknowledging the need to find a middle ground after the previous offers. I believe this is a fair valuation that balances the strengths and uncertainties highlighted in our discussions.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1600. This price reflects the strong model performance and long data life that we have discussed, while also considering the previous valuations from both sides. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance between the strengths and uncertainties highlighted by the analysts.
