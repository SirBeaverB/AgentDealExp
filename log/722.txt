Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The market score of 0.3 indicates there is some demand for the product, but the numerous NULL traits suggest a lack of clarity on its overall value and performance. This leads to a moderate price expectation reflecting limited but potential interest.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The model shows a decent performance improvement (MPI of 0.25) and has enough capacity, which suggests it can handle the required data efficiently. However, high data entropy indicates complexity and potential challenges in data processing, while a short data life implies the product may require frequent updates or replacements. The market value of 0.3 suggests a moderate demand. Overall, the combination of these traits leads to a reasonable valuation, but the uncertainty due to high entropy and short data lifespan tempers confidence.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Deal Price:1655.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the robust performance of the data product and its capacity to efficiently handle complex data, despite the challenges posed by high entropy and a short data lifespan. I believe this valuation captures the product's value well in the current market.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 1600. I believe this price better reflects the uncertainties surrounding the data product's performance and the challenges noted, such as high entropy and a short data lifespan. This allows for a more cautious investment while still acknowledging the potential value the product may hold.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 1700. This price reflects a balanced consideration of the product's strong performance and the associated risks, allowing for a reasonable compromise while still valuing the product's potential.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 1650. This price acknowledges the seller's recent offer and reflects a fair compromise, considering the product's strong performance while maintaining a cautious approach to the associated risks.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 1660. I believe this price reflects a balanced consideration of the product's performance and the associated risks, while also acknowledging the buyer's previous offers. Let's move forward with a fair negotiation.
Round 3 (Buyer): I offer 1650. This price is a reasonable compromise, considering the seller's last offer of 1660 and my previous offers. It reflects my acknowledgment of the product's value while also addressing the associated risks. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.
