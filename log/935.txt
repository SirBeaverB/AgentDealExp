Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life and low data entropy, indicating that it provides relatively stable and reliable insights. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement and market demand makes it difficult to ascertain its full potential value. The available traits suggest it could serve a specific need, hence the moderate price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3, which indicates it can enhance performance to some degree. The low data entropy suggests the data is relatively clean and structured, making it easier to work with. The medium data life implies it has a reasonable lifespan for usability. However, the market score of 0.4 indicates modest demand. Given these factors, the expected price reflects the product's potential value in a moderately competitive market.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
