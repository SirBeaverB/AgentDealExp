Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a low data entropy, which indicates that the data is consistent and reliable. However, the short data life and lack of model performance improvement suggest limited long-term value. The market rating of 0.4 indicates that there is moderate demand, which could translate to a modest price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing for users looking for efficiency gains. The capacity being "enough" suggests it can handle current demands, while low data entropy indicates the data is relatively clean and reliable. However, the short data life may limit its long-term usability, and the lack of historical data makes it difficult to fully assess its value over time. The market score of 0.4 indicates a decent demand, though it¡¯s not overly strong. Therefore, the price reflects a balance of these factors.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
