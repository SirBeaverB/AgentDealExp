Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1000', 'reason': "The market score of 0.4 indicates a low demand or market size for the product. Additionally, the absence of key performance traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, Data Life, and History suggests a lack of clarity about the product's capabilities and potential value. Thus, the expected price is conservative.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The model performance improvement of 0.25 suggests a notable enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in competitive markets. However, the NULL values for capacity and data entropy limit the understanding of the product's scalability and data quality, respectively. The long data life indicates durability and potential for ongoing use, and the market value of 0.4 suggests a moderate demand. Overall, the product has potential value but with some uncertainties due to the missing traits.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
