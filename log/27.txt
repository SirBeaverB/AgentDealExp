Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data life, suggesting it has a reasonable duration for usability and relevance, which could attract potential buyers. However, the lack of information on Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, Data Entropy, and other traits limits a more precise valuation. Given the medium data life, it is plausible to assume some value, but the uncertainty reduces confidence.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) is relatively good at 0.2, indicating that the product can enhance performance significantly, which can be valuable in the market. However, the lack of information on capacity, data entropy, and history limits the assessment. The medium data life suggests it has a reasonable lifespan but is not optimal. The market rating of 0.3 indicates low demand, which may also affect the price. Overall, the product shows potential but lacks sufficient traits for a higher valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
