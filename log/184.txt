Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data entropy and sufficient capacity, suggesting it can handle a moderate level of complexity and demand. However, the short data life implies that its usefulness may decline quickly, which can limit its long-term value. The market rating of 0.5 indicates a moderate level of market interest, which also affects pricing. Overall, while there are some positive traits, the short data life and NULL traits create uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': "The product exhibits a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which suggests it can provide some enhancement over existing solutions. However, the data life is short, and there are several traits that are not available, including history, which limits the ability to assess the product's reliability and long-term value. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand but not strong. Overall, these factors suggest a mid-range valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
