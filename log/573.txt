Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it has the potential to enhance model accuracy or efficiency, which is valuable in data-driven industries. However, the low Data Entropy suggests that the data is somewhat predictable and may not provide significant insights. The lack of information on Data Life, History, and Market limits the understanding of the product's longevity and market demand, which prevents a higher valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating that it can enhance existing models' effectiveness, which is a valuable trait in the market. Additionally, it has a low Data Entropy and a long Data Life, suggesting that the data is reliable and will remain relevant for an extended period. While the market demand is moderate at 0.5, the combination of these strengths justifies a reasonable price. However, the lack of historical data limits the confidence in the valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
