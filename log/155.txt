Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': 'The product has only one trait available (Data Life', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be appealing for businesses looking to improve their analytics. The market value of 0.4 suggests there is some demand for this type of product, though the short data life and lack of other metrics like Capacity and Data Entropy could limit its overall value and usability. The combination of these factors leads to a modest expected price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
