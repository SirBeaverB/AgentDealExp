Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a decent enhancement in model capabilities, which can attract interest from businesses looking to improve their data-driven decisions. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle a reasonable volume of data. A medium data entropy indicates variability in the data, which could be beneficial depending on the use case. The long data life suggests longevity and durability of the data\'s relevance in the market. However, the NULL history indicates a lack of historical performance or usage data, which could limit the confidence in its effectiveness. The market score of 0.5 also suggests moderate demand, balancing the potential value. Overall, these factors lead to a moderate price expectation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be appealing to buyers looking for efficiency gains. The capacity being "enough" suggests that the product can handle the demands of potential users. The medium data entropy indicates a balanced level of data quality, while a long data life suggests durability and relevance over time. However, the market score of 0.5 shows that while there is some demand, it is not exceptionally high. Given these factors, the expected price reflects a reasonable valuation for a product that has potential but is not in high demand.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
