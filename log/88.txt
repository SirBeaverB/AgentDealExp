Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a low data entropy, indicating that the data is relatively clean and reliable. The capacity is sufficient, which suggests that it can handle the necessary workloads. However, the market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, and the lack of information regarding model performance and history raises some concerns about its overall effectiveness. Given these factors, a moderate price is justified.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': "The product shows a moderate model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating it can enhance existing systems. The capacity is sufficient, and low data entropy suggests the data is reliable and structured. However, the medium data life and a market score of 0.5 indicate that while there is some potential, it may not be the most cutting-edge or in high demand. The lack of historical data raises some concerns about the product's proven track record.", 'confidence': 'medium'}
