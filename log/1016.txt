Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has a medium data entropy and sufficient capacity, which suggests it can handle some level of complexity and volume. However, the short data life and lack of information on model performance and history indicate limited long-term value. The market score of 0.3 suggests an emerging or niche market, which may not support a high valuation. Overall, while it has potential, the uncertainties and limitations keep the expected price moderate.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in results, which adds some value, but the short data life suggests limited long-term utility. The market value of 0.3 indicates that while there is some interest, it is not particularly strong. Overall, the product may have some value in a niche market.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
