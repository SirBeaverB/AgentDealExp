Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product has a long data life and sufficient capacity, which indicates that it can be useful for an extended period. However, the high data entropy might suggest complexity in the data, which could deter some users. The market demand is moderate (0.5), indicating that while there is some interest, it is not overwhelming. The lack of information on model performance improvement and history adds uncertainty, but overall, the product still holds some value due to its long data life and adequate capacity.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The product demonstrates a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates it can enhance the effectiveness of existing models. Additionally, the capacity is stated as "enough," suggesting it can handle sufficient data loads. High data entropy means the data is diverse and potentially valuable for analysis, and a long data life indicates it remains relevant over time. However, the market size rating of 0.5 suggests moderate demand, which tempers the potential price. Overall, the combination of these factors justifies a valuation of 15,000.', 'confidence': 'high'}
