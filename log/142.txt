{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 0.2), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('low', 'low'), 'data_life': ('long', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '7500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a modest improvement in performance, which can attract interest in certain markets. The capacity being "enough" suggests that it can handle the necessary workload. However, low data entropy implies a more predictable and stable dataset, which can be beneficial. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, but the NULL values for Data Life and History limit confidence in the product\'s longevity and reliability. Overall, the product could be valuable, but caution is warranted due to missing information.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The product shows a notable Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, indicating it can enhance model accuracy or efficiency, which is valuable in data-driven industries. Additionally, it has a long data life and low data entropy, suggesting high reliability and sustainability of the data. The market score of 0.5 indicates moderate demand, which supports a reasonable price. However, the lack of historical data limits confidence somewhat.', 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 18000. This price reflects the exceptional Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which significantly enhances model accuracy and efficiency, making it a highly valuable asset in data-driven industries. The long data life and low data entropy further emphasize the reliability and sustainability of this data product.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 6000. While I recognize the seller's emphasis on the Model Performance Improvement and the perceived reliability of the data product, my valuation considers the moderate market demand and the missing information on Data Life and History. Thus, I believe a lower price is justified.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 12000. The data's exceptional Model Performance Improvement and reliability are significant, but given the moderate market demand and need for more information, a reasonable middle ground is necessary for a fair deal.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 11500. The data's performance improvement and reliability are indeed commendable, but I believe a price closer to my offer reflects the current market dynamics and allows us to reach an equitable agreement.
Round 3 (Seller): I offer 11500. I believe this price reflects the value of the data while also considering the current market dynamics. It is a fair compromise that acknowledges the buyer's interest while still maintaining the integrity of the product's worth.
