Buying Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a significant potential for enhancing model accuracy or efficiency, which is valuable in data-driven industries. However, the high data entropy suggests complexity and variability in the data, which could limit usability without additional context. The lack of information on data life, history, and market diminishes the overall confidence in the valuation, but the potential performance benefits justify a moderate price.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 suggests a reasonable enhancement in performance, which is a positive trait. The market metric of 0.5 indicates a moderate demand for the product, which supports a higher price point. However, the high data entropy and short data life suggest that the product may not have long-term utility, which could limit its value. The absence of historical data is also a concern, but the existing traits provide enough basis for a valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
