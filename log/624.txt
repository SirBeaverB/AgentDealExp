{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'medium'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating it can enhance existing models effectively. However, the medium data entropy and short data life suggest limited long-term utility. The market value of 0.5 indicates there is some interest, but the NULL history trait may raise concerns about reliability and past performance. Therefore, while the product has potential, its short data life and lack of historical context may limit its overall value.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 suggests a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive in certain markets. The capacity being "enough" indicates that the product can handle a reasonable amount of data. However, the medium data entropy and short data life indicate some limitations in the longevity and reliability of the data, which could affect long-term value. The market score of 0.5 implies moderate demand, which aligns with the expected price. Overall, while there are some positive traits, the short data life and lack of history create uncertainty.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
