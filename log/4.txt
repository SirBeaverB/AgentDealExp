Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a moderate enhancement in model performance, which can be valuable in data-driven industries. However, the short data life and the presence of several NULL traits, including market capacity and history, suggest limited applicability and a lack of comprehensive insights into the product's overall value. The market score of 0.3 indicates moderate demand, which also contributes to a cautious valuation.", 'confidence': 'low'}
