Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.2, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('short', 'short'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 0.3)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '500', 'reason': 'The product has a short data life and a low market score of 0.3, which indicates limited demand and potential value. The lack of critical traits such as Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, and Data Entropy further reduces confidence in its utility, leading to a conservative valuation.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': "The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a tangible enhancement in performance, which can be appealing to potential users. However, the short data life and several NULL traits (especially capacity and data entropy) suggest limitations in the product's overall utility and longevity. The market value of 0.3 indicates some interest, but the lack of comprehensive data makes it challenging to fully assess the product's potential.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Deal Price:5500.0
Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 6000. This price reflects the substantial Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, highlighting the data product's potential to significantly enhance performance for users. Despite some limitations, I believe this value captures its appeal in the market.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 400. The data product has a short data life and a low market score of 0.3, indicating limited demand and potential value. The absence of critical traits like Model Performance Improvement, Capacity, and Data Entropy further diminishes its appeal, leading me to value it conservatively.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 5500. Given the significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, this data product holds substantial value in enhancing model accuracy and performance, which is far more compelling than the low market score indicated by the other party. My price reflects the high potential and utility of this data in the right applications.
Round 2 (Buyer): I offer 5500. The significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 suggests a strong potential for enhancing model accuracy, making this data product more valuable than the low market score indicates. My price reflects the balance between this potential and the current market conditions.
