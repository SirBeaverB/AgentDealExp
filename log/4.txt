Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The product has a limited amount of available data due to several NULL traits, which restricts a comprehensive analysis. However, the historical data suggests some level of performance, and the market score of 0.3 indicates a moderate demand. Given these factors, a conservative price reflecting the uncertainty and limited information available is appropriate.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2 indicates a modest enhancement in performance, while the low data entropy suggests the data is relatively straightforward to analyze. However, the small capacity and short data life limit its long-term value. The market score of 0.3 reflects a low demand for this product, which further lowers its valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
