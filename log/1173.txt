Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product has sufficient capacity and high data entropy, which suggests it could handle complex datasets and provide valuable insights. However, the lack of information on model performance improvement, data life, history, and market demand limits the ability to accurately assess its full potential. Given these factors, the price reflects a moderate valuation based on available traits.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The model performance improvement (MPI) of 0.3 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be attractive for users looking to optimize their systems. However, the high data entropy suggests complex data, which may require sophisticated handling. The short data life implies that the relevance of the data may diminish quickly, impacting long-term value. The market score of 0.4 indicates a modest demand, which is a positive factor but not strong enough to greatly increase the price. Overall, these factors lead to a reasonable valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
