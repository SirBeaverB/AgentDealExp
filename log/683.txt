{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('long', 'long'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.3, 'NULL')}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating that it has the potential to enhance performance, which is valuable in data-driven decision-making. The long Data Life implies longevity and consistent value over time. However, the lack of information on Data Entropy, History, and Market limits the confidence in market demand and potential applications. Thus, while the product has promising traits, uncertainties reduce the overall valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The product has a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, which indicates it can enhance performance to some degree. The capacity is sufficient, and the data life is long, suggesting that the product will remain relevant for an extended period. However, the medium data entropy implies there may be complexity in data interpretation. The market value being at 0.3 reflects a reasonable demand, though not exceptionally high. Overall, these factors lead to a valuation that respects the potential of the product while accounting for its limitations.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
