Arguments:
{'model_performance_improvement': (0.3, 'NULL'), 'capacity': ('enough', 'enough'), 'data_entrophy': ('high', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'medium'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.4, 0.4)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '3000', 'reason': "The product has a medium data life and sufficient capacity, indicating it can handle a reasonable amount of data processing and storage. However, the NULL traits, particularly Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy, significantly limit the product's attractiveness and potential effectiveness. The market value of 0.4 suggests moderate demand, which further constrains the price. Therefore, considering these factors, a price around 3000 reflects a cautious optimism based on existing traits.", 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': "The product shows a significant Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.3, indicating it has the potential to enhance existing systems or processes. However, the high data entropy suggests that the data is complex and potentially challenging to analyze. The medium data life indicates that it may not be as timely as newer products, but the capacity being sufficient allows for practical usage. The market score of 0.4 suggests there is some demand, but it's not overwhelming. Overall, the product has strengths but also notable weaknesses, leading to a moderate valuation.", 'confidence': 'medium'}

Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 2900. Given the limitations in Model Performance Improvement and Data Entropy, I believe a price reduction is more reflective of the product's overall value in the current market. This adjustment takes into account the medium data life and the market demand.
Round 2 (Seller): I offer 2950. This price reflects a fair compromise considering the noted performance improvement while still addressing the concerns about limitations in data quality.
