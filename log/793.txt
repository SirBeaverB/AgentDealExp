Buying Valuer:
{'price': '2500', 'reason': 'The product shows a Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25, indicating a moderate enhancement in performance. However, the lack of additional traits such as Data Entropy, Data Life, History, and Market leaves significant uncertainties about its overall value and applicability. Given the MPI and the capacity being adequate, it suggests potential but limited market appeal, hence the valuation reflects that balance.', 'confidence': 'low'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '15000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a significant enhancement in model accuracy, which is highly valuable in data-driven industries. With a medium data life and high data entropy, the product likely provides substantial insights from diverse data sources. The market demand of 0.4 suggests a moderate interest, but the lack of historical data limits the confidence in predicting long-term performance. Overall, the combination of traits indicates a reasonably valuable product despite some uncertainties.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
