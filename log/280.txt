Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': 'The product shows a moderate Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.2, which indicates a positive impact on performance. The capacity is sufficient, and the data life is long, suggesting that it can be utilized effectively over time. However, the medium data entropy and the market rating of 0.5 indicate some limitations in its appeal. The lack of historical data (NULL) introduces uncertainty, but the overall traits suggest a reasonable value in a moderately competitive market.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
