{'model_performance_improvement': (0.25, 0.25), 'capacity': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_entrophy': ('NULL', 'NULL'), 'data_life': ('medium', 'NULL'), 'history': (['NULL'], 'NULL'), 'market': (0.5, 0.5)}
Buying Valuer:
{'price': '5000', 'reason': 'The Model Performance Improvement (MPI) of 0.25 indicates a moderate enhancement in performance, which can be valuable in a competitive market. The market score of 0.5 suggests a decent demand for the product, but the numerous NULL traits indicate a lack of critical data that could significantly affect the valuation. Therefore, while there is potential, the uncertainty limits the confidence in the valuation.', 'confidence': 'medium'}
Selling Valuer:
{'price': '1500', 'reason': "The product shows a decent model performance improvement of 0.25, indicating it has the potential to enhance existing systems. However, the absence of specific traits like capacity and data entropy limits the overall insight into its full capabilities. The medium data life suggests it's not the most cutting-edge product, but given the market score of 0.5, there is some demand that can be capitalized on. Considering these factors, a moderate price is justified.", 'confidence': 'medium'}

Dealing Process:
Round 1 (Seller): I offer 1800. This price reflects the potential of the data product to significantly enhance existing systems, despite its medium data life and the absence of specific traits like capacity and data entropy. Given the market demand and the performance improvement it provides, I believe this price is justified.
Round 1 (Buyer): I offer 3000.
